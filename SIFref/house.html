                    <h1>House Resources</h1>
                    <p>As much as a house is defined by its place in the Seven Kingdoms, its
                        history, deeds, and alliances, a house is essentially a collection of seven Resources.
                        These
                        values will fluctuate during house creation and more during game play,
                        rising and falling depending on how well you play the game of thrones.</p>
                    <p>Below are descriptions of each of the seven Resources</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h4>Defense</h4>
                    <p>Defense describes fortifications, castles, keeps, towers, and other structures
                        that serve to protect your holdings. Defense also describes the
                        presence and quality of roads, representing the ability to move troops
                        and supplies to threatened areas.</p>

                    <h4>Influence</h4>
                    <p>Influence describes your presence in the Seven Kingdoms, how other
                        houses see you, and the notoriety attached to your name. A high Influence
                        resource typically describes one of the great houses or the royal
                        family, while a low Influence resource would describe a house of little
                        consequence, small and largely unknown beyond the lands of their liege.
                        Influence is also important in determining your characters’ maximum
                        Status.</p>

                    <p>Law encompasses two things: the extent to which the smallfolk respect
                        and fear you and the threat of bandits, brigands, raiders, and other external
                        and internal threats. Law is something your family must maintain,
                        and if you don’t invest in keeping your realm safe, it could fall into chaos.</p>

                    <h1>Holdings</h1>
                    <p>In a way, holdings are like investments in that you use your resources to
                        select specific elements in the form of castles, towers, cities, towns,
                        soldiers, mines, and more. When you define your holdings, you do not
                        reduce the resource; instead, allocate those points to a specific expression
                        of that resource.</p>
                    <p>If your resources are later reduced, such as by a blight sweeping through
                        your crops or losing a battle, you may lose your investment. Similarly, if
                        an investment is destroyed, such as having an enemy burn your castle to
                        the ground, you lose the resources you invested in that particular holding.</p>

                    <h2>Land Holdings</h2>
                    <p>Lands describe the terrain and extent of your actual holdings. Lands
                        may be forests, lakes, hills, mountains, coastlines, and more, all based
                        on where your house is situated and the terrain of your realm. Each
                        Land investment is called a domain. Each domain is roughly a league (3
                        miles).</p>
                    <p>Domains each have two components, features and terrain. A feature is
                        something found on that land such as a town, river, woods, or coastline. A
                        domain can have as many features as you’d like to invest. A domain without
                        a feature is barren, being a desert, scrubland, or waste depending on
                        the realm.</p>
                    <p>If you cannot afford to
                        invest in a domain, your holdings are smaller than a league and extend
                        out around your primary stronghold.</p>

                    <h2>Law Holdings</h2>
                    <p>Unlike other resources, Law does not have holdings for investment. Instead,
                        your Law resource describes the extent of your authority over
                        your lands, specifically as it applies to drawing resources from your lands
                        with minimal loss due to crime, banditry, and villainy.</p>
                    <p>Maintaining a
                        high Law resource helps reduce waste and loss, generating the full potential
                        of Wealth and allowing your Population to grow. But if you let
                        Law lapse, you derive less and less of your resources, and your Population
                        growth shrinks until it can actually diminish.</p>

                    <p>Like Law, you do not invest Population Holdings. Instead, your Population
                        describes the density of people that live on your lands. The
                        greater your Population, the more people occupy your lands. Population,
                        again like Law, modifies the outcome of your House Fortunes;
                        however, more people bring more opportunities for mishaps.</p>
                    <p>Similarly,
                        fewer people mean greater chances for trouble to brew in remote
                        corners of your lands. From the following, find your modifier to your
                        House Fortunes roll.</p>

                    <h2>Power Holdings</h2>
                    <p>From your Power resource, you derive your family’s military might, its
                        sworn swords, knights, guardsmen, and banners that fight on your behalf.
                        You can invest Power into banners, ships, or units.</p>
                    <h3>Banner Houses</h3>
                    <h5>Cost: 20 for the first house, 10 for the second, and 5 for each additional</h5>
                    <p>Banner houses are noble families and landed knights that have sworn
                        vows of service and loyalty to your house in exchange for your house’s
                        protection, support, and aid in times of trouble. While promises bind
                        the banner house to your own, such vows can be tested when personal
                        ambitions get in the way of honor and duty. Moreover, smaller houses
                        often come to envy the power and influence of the larger houses to whom they are sworn, and
                        betrayals, while uncommon since the consequences
                        can be so severe, can and do occur.</p>
                    <p>The relationship between you and your vassal is much the same as
                        your relationship between you and your liege, meaning that as you are
                        sworn to provide military and financial support to your lord, so, too, is
                        your banner house. The benefit of the banner house is that it can be
                        called to lend military assistance when in need, grant you 1 Test Die on
                        your Status Tests for House Fortunes (for each banner house) and can
                        even receive House Fortune results if desired (see facing page). However,
                        they are not blindly obedient, and though they are sworn to you, their
                        interests usually come first. Furthermore, if you want to keep the loyalty
                        of a banner house, you must also support them and their conflicts, even
                        if doing so would interfere with your own plans.</p>
                    <p>Your banner house (or houses) begins loyal to your family, and their
                        dispositions start at Friendly. As with all Narrator characters, developments
                        in the campaign, you and your family’s choices, and reputation
                        can improve or worsen a banner house’s disposition toward you. Should
                        a banner’s disposition ever fall to Malicious, you lose them and the
                        points you invested into this house.</p>

                    <h2>Wealth Holdings</h2>
                    <p>Wealth describes your family’s soluble resources, explaining how they
                        generate their income. You can invest Wealth into specific holdings,
                        which grant specific benefits, or keep it free to spend in other areas as
                        needed. It’s often best to keep some of your Wealth free for problems
                        that might crop up during game play.</p>
                    <p>
                        The following holdings represent the most common types. Others
                        might be available with your Narrator’s permission (in which case you
                        should all work together to come up with a workable benefit and relevant
                        requirements). Many holdings include requirements, which you must meet
                        before investing in the holding.

                    <p>
                        You need land in order to invest in Wealth Holdings. Each Land Holding ("domain") may have up to
                        two Wealth Holdings.

                    <p>In addition to the opportunity to make a House Fortunes roll, a House may also make one Action per month.</p>
                    <p>If your House would like to make an action that does not fall into the categories below, work with the Narrator.</p>
                    <h3>Manage Resources</h3>
                    <p>Among the easiest and most common actions a lord can take, managing Resources allows you to convert one Resource to another. Not all Resources may be exchanged, so consult the table below.</p>
                    <p>As with other Actions, you may only convert resources once per month, though you can do so in any amount. Generally, you may only convert one Resource at a time.<br/>
                        You may <strong>Rush</strong> the conversion to convert two Resources. This carries the penalty of a worse exchange rate, however.</p>
