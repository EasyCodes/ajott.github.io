                                Charm is the simple act of cultivating
                                friendships and alliances, or to reason with enemies and avoid
                                conflict. When you defeat an opponent using charm, you improve
                                the target’s disposition by one step. The target’s improved disposition
                                lasts until circumstances would worsen their disposition
                                against you—such as a betrayal on your part or a rival inciting the
                                opponent against you. In addition, you gain +1D on all Deception
                                and Persuasion tests during your next intrigue against this
                                opponent.

                            <p>Sometimes a forceful argument can get your point across where charm
                                or seduction might fail. Convince imparts your position or idea by
                                simply putting the idea out there in a reasoned and logical manner.
                                Convince is a stated desire that stands on its merits alone. It is often
                                less effective because it isn’t backed up by a threat, and there may not
                                be something in it for the subject. Thus, it often takes longer to persuade
                                a subject to your position, especially when they are ill-disposed
                                against you.</p>

                                Whenever you defeat an opponent
                                using Convince, you are honestly trying to get the target to assist
                                you or to agree with your position. Using Convince does nothing
                                to improve the target’s disposition; instead, Convince gets them to
                                support your position or grant you assistance. Even dire enemies can
                                be persuaded to help, provided they have sufficient cause, though
                                there’s nothing to say the enemy won’t use the opportunity to betray
                                you later. A convinced target assists you through the particular trial
                                but no further.

                                Inciting a target involves turning the
                                opponent against another opponent, usually by producing evidence
                                of betrayal, vile acts, or revealing any other sordid details your opponent
                                might find repugnant. Incite is often powerful, but it produces
                                short-term effects. An incited target’s attitude to the individual,
                                or ganization, or house you indicate shifts a number of steps
                                downward equal to your rank in Persuasion. Each day after you
                                use Incite on the target, his attitude toward the target improves by
                                one step until it returns to its starting disposition. Typically, only
                                targets whose disposition is worsened to Malicious attack the individual
                                or members of the house or organization you indicate.

                                Intimidate is bluster and threats used to frighten or cow your opponent.
                                A successful use of Intimidate either drives off the target—
                                if he can flee—or improves his disposition to Amiable or one step
                                better if already Amiable for as long as you remain in the target’s
                                presence if the target cannot flee. The target does as you ask, reveals
                                information, and possibly lies if he believes he has no other recourse
                                to escape your presence. An intimidated target’s disposition in future
                                intrigues is always Unfriendly or worse.

                            <p>Of all the techniques, seduction is the most subtle. Use of this technique
                                requires patience and practice, as well as a keen eye for body language and innuendo to
                                guide your own words and behavior. If you defeat an
                                opponent using Seduce, you fill the subject with feelings of desire—or
                                at the very least the willingness to give into your advances.</p>

                                By playing to your opponent’s lust and
                                desires, a defeat using Seduce usually results in some carnal act of
                                passion or at the very least a temporary increase to the target’s disposition.
                                Seduction instills feelings of pleasure and affection in the
                                target, blinding them to your faults and ulterior motives. You improve
                                the target’s disposition by a number of steps equal to your rank
                                in Persuasion. If the target is attracted to your gender, is capable of
                                physical love, and is at least Friendly, he or she gives in. As such, it
                                may take several intrigues to seduce a target properly.
                                Each day after the encounter, the target’s disposition shifts down
                                one until it falls to one step below his or her starting disposition.
                                You can sustain the feelings of attraction by courting the individual
                                and by using Charm to create a more permanent disposition. Characters
                                with dispositions that started at Dislike or worse but who are
                                seduced pretend to be attracted and even go so far as to engage in
                                lovemaking or some other act of passion. They only follow through
                                if they believe such an act will advance their position or give them
                                some advantage over you—whether it’s to plant a bastard in the
                                womb or a knife in the throat.

                                what you want, but when he has completed the task, his disposition
                                falls by one step. An opponent whose disposition is Neutral
                                or Dislike may or may not perform the task based on the danger
                                posed to him. Again, his disposition worsens by one step. Finally,
                                opponents with dispositions worse than Dislike attack you or flee
                                if attacking is not an option.

                    <p>Composure is to Intrigue as Health is to Combat.</p>
                    <p>Whenever your opponent's Influence exceeds your Intrigue Defense, it causes you to lose
                        Composure. If your composure is reduced to 0, you are defeated.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can reduce the amount of incoming Influence by taking a measure of
                        <strong>Frustration</strong>. <br />
                        Each level of Frustration gained reduces incoming Influence by an amount of Influence equal to your Will rank.
                        However, each level also imposes <strong>a -1D penalty to all Persuasion and Deception tests</strong> for the
                        duration of the intrigue.<br />
                        Should your Frustration ever exceed your Will rank, you lose your Composure and are
                        defeated.<br />
                        At the end of every Intrigue, win or lose, all Frustration is removed.</p>
