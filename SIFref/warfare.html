                    <h1 class="headingLight">Warfare Orders</h1>
                    <p>Units in warfare do nothing unless commanded. The Commander of a force may make as many Orders as
                        his rank in Warfare.</p>
                    <p>Characters may be specified as Sub-Commanders. An army may have one Sub-Commander per two full
                        units. Sub-Commanders may make one Order per round.
                    </p>
                    <p>Orders are given in alternating fashion; the Commander or Sub-Commander with the best Initiative
                        roll gives his order first, followed by the others in order of Initiative.<br />
                        If one army has more Orders than the other, either through a higher Warfare rank or
                        Sub-Commanders, they continue to issue orders until the total number is reached, with the
                        opposing army removed from the turn order for that round.</p>
                    <p>Many Orders have lasting results. These Standing Orders are resolved after normal Orders are
                        given, and after Player Actions are taken. A new Order given to a unit will supercede its
                        previous Standing Order.</p>
                    <p>Orders that may be used if the group is playing by Advanced Warfare rules are highlighted.</p>

                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Units</h4>
                        <p>Units are the most common investment for noble houses. They reflect
                            the standing armies that support the household and can be called up
                            to defend the family’s lands at a moment’s notice. Each unit consists of
                            100 men, 20 men and horses, or 5 warships.</p>
                        <p>Each unit has a broadly defined type, a role it plays in battle. Type describes
                            how the unit operates and describes the abilities you can improve
                            with the unit’s Experience. In addition, type also modifies a unit’s
                            Discipline, increasing or reducing the Difficulty to control the unit in
                            battle.</p>
                        <p>Most units have just one type, but it’s possible to build units with
                            two or more types provided you invest the total Power to meet the
                            cost for each unit type. So, to build Trained Archer/Infantry, you must invest 10 Power (3
                            for trained + 3 archer + 4 infantry). When investing
                            experience for a unit with two or more types, you may invest the
                            experience into any Key Ability listed for all unit types the unit possesses.
                            Discipline modifiers are cumulative. So, in the above example,
                            our archer/infantry would have a Challenge (9) discipline (6 base +
                            3 archer + 0 infantry). While any combination between types in any
                            quantity is possible, too much diversification in a single unit eats up so
                            much Power, you are unlikely to field any other units.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>As part of a House's Manage Resources Action, a unit may be changed into another type. If the
                            new type's Power Cost is higher, subtract the difference from the House's Power. If it is
                            lower, you do not gain a refund.</p>
                        <p>As with Characters, Units have health. A unit's health is its <strong>Endurance Rank ×
                                3</strong></p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Units are recruited at a specific level of training. This training level provides the base
                            power cost for a unit, the base Discipline check for a unit, and the amount of Experience
                            they have available to spend.</p>
                        <p>To raise an ability one rank, it costs 20 experience. A unit's type determines which
                            abilities can be raised with experience.</p>

                                        they are more expensive to field and can be unreliable in larger engagements.

                                        their foes.

                    <p>Units come with a default set of equipment, detailed below. However, units can be equipped with
                        better armor and weapons by spending <strong>one point of Wealth</strong> per unit upgraded.</p>
                    <p>If you upgrade a unit, see the second table for their upgraded stats.</p>
                    <p>Units are, by default, abstractions. However, if so inclined, you can outfit a unit with weapons
                        or armor not ordinarily available in the below lists.<br />
                        If you choose to do so, find the <a href="./weapons.html#weapons">weapon</a> or <a
                            href="./weapons.html#armor">armor</a> cost, and multiply by 100 (if Footsoldiers) or 20 (if
                        Cavalry). Due to the large size of the order, the provisioner may impose additonal fees or
                        confer a discount, at the Narrator's discretion.<br />

                    <p>Prior to Player Actions and Orders, an army may fire a number of siege weapons up to the
                        Commander's Warfare rank.</p>
                    <p>Siege weapons must be crewed by a unit of Engineers. Each unit of Engineers can control up to
                        four siege weapons.</p>
                    <p>The Engineers controlling a given siege weapon test their Warfare against the target unit's
                        Defense. If successful, resolve damage as normal.</p>
                    <p>Siege weapons need a full round to reload and re-arm, effectively allowing them to fire only
                        every other round.</p>

                    <h4>Facing</h4>
                    <p>Facing describes what a unit can see, and whom it's most likely to attack. Penalties and bonuses may be conferred depending on a unit's position relative to an enemy.</p>
                    <p><strong>Flanks:</strong> When a unit attacks another unit's flank, the attacker gains +1B on its Fighting test.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rear:</strong> When a unit attacks another unit's rear, the attacker gains +1D on its Fighting test.</p>
                    <p><strong>Surrounded:</strong> When several units surround an enemy, those attacking the front gain +1B; the flanks, +1D; the rear, +2D.</p>
                    <p><strong>Attacking the Attackers:</strong> A unit may attack a flanking enemy without changing its facing. Doing so imposes -1D on its Fighting test. A unit cannot attack a unit that is behind it.</p>
                    <h4>Facing Orders</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reverse (Difficulty +0): </strong>The unit will reverse so it faces the opposite way. On a failed Warfare test, the unit still turns, but attackers will retain any bonus until the end of the round.</p>
                    <p><strong>Wheel (Difficulty +3): </strong>The unit will change its facing to the left or right. On a failed Warfare test, the unit still turns, but attackers will retain any bonus until the end of the round.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4>Formations</h4>
                    <p>A unit’s formation reflects how the individual members rank up, remain
                            organized, and how they can respond to attacks. Some formations
                            are particularly suited to resisting volleys of arrows (checkered,
                            for example), while other formations mean big trouble to enemies
                            charging the unit.</p> 
                            <p>As an order, a commander can change a unit’s formation
                            to better respond to other threats.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>When incoming damage exceeds a unit's Armor Rating, they will take damage. This damage is
                        subtracted from the Unit's health. So long as the unit has at least 1 point of health, it is not
                        impaired in any way.</p>
                    <p>If a unit's health is reduced to 0, it becomes <strong>Disorganized</strong>. The unit takes -1D
                        (cumulative) on all tests, and its Discipline modifier increases by +3<br />
                        If the unit is Re-organized via an Order, its health is restored to full but it keeps the -1D.
                        Each time a unit is disorganized, it gains an additional -1D penalty. Should these penalties
                        ever equal the unit's Endurance rank, it is destroyed.</p>
                    <p>If a unit takes any damage while Disorganized, it becomes <strong>Routed</strong>. If the damage
                        would exceed twice the Unit's health, it is destroyed instead. A routing unit immediately
                        changes to the Mob formation, and at the end of the attacker's turn it sprints away from the
                        attacker.<br />
                        If the unit is Rallied via an Order, it becomes Disorganized instead.</p>
                    <p>If a Routed unit takes any damage, if a unit takes damages in excess of twice its health, or if
                        the combined penalties from Disorganization total the unit's Endurance, it is
                        <strong>Destroyed</strong> and removed from play.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intact:</strong> Remove all damage and Penalty dice from the unit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Destroyed:</strong> Permanently remove the Power your House invested into the unit. There
                        is no refund.</p>
                    <p><strong>Training:</strong> You do not pay for the increased rank using Power.<br />
                        Adjustments to training may require you to reduce a unit's Abilities in order to cover a
                        deficit, or allow you to improve abilities with new experience.<br />
                        Should the adjustment reduce a unit's Training to below Green, they are Destroyed as above - the
                        influx of replacements were too green and undisciplined, and the unit is no longer of any use in
                        combat.</p>
