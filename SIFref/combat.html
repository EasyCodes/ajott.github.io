                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Damage</h1>
                        <p>Damage is a nearly unavoidable consequence of combat. Damage taken to your health is minor -
                            scrapes, small cuts, or bruises. Your health is restored at the end of every combat. Damage
                            can be reduced by taking Injuries and Wounds. This is most commonly done when an incoming
                            blow would reduce your health to 0.</p>
                        <h5 class="w3-text-gold" style="text-align: center;">Injuries</h5>
                        <p>Injuries are more significant than damage to health, and each injury a character sustains
                            imposes
                            <strong>a -1 penalty to all rolls.</strong> Taking an injury reduces incoming damage by your
                            Endurance rank. You may have as many injuries as you have ranks in Endurance. If you're
                            maxed on injuries, you
                            must then start accumulating Wounds.</p>

                        <p>Wounds are major damage. Each wound a character sustains imposes <strong>a -1D penalty to all
                                rolls.</strong> Taking a wound completely negates damage from an incoming attack. If you
                            ever sustain as many Wounds as you have ranks in Endurance, you will die.</p>

                            <p>The best way to recover from an injury is to receive Healing. The Healing ability can
                                help speed
                                recovery from injuries by allowing the healer
                                to substitute his or her Healing test result for the Endurance test. Since
                                injuries impose a penalty on all tests, the presence of a healer can greatly
                                improve a character’s chances for recovery.
                                To use Healing, a healer must devote at least 4 hours per day of
                                treatment to the injured character. When the character would roll an
                                Endurance test, the healer instead rolls a Healing test. The result of this
                                test must be taken. A failed Healing test does not result in the worsening
                                of injuries.</p>

                        If you fear imminent defeat, you may, on your turn, offer the Narrator
                        terms by which your character will go down to defeat, including the
                        outcome. So for example, you can offer to have your character defeated
                        and left unconscious or taken for ransom. The Narrator has the option
                        of accepting your terms, making a counter-offer, or rejecting them. If
                        you reject the Narrator’s counter-offer, you cannot yield.</p>

                        your opponent chooses for you. If your family is particularly poor, you
                        might choose maiming or death over a ransom. Similarly, if your opponent
                        would see you dead, you might opt for unconsciousness instead.</p>
