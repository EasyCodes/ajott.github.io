                                            <h4 class="headingLight">Cost: 10 exp</h4>
                                            <p>You can acquire a new specialty at 1B or improve an existing specialty by +1B.
                                                If you’re improving a specialty, the specialty dice cannot exceed
                                                your rank in the governing ability.
                                                Therefore, if you have Fighting 3 (Axes 2B, Long Blades 3B), you could improve Axes to
                                                3B, but you couldn’t improve Long Blades until your Fighting is at least 4.

                                            <h4 class="headingLight">Cost: 30 exp</h4>
                                            <p>You can spend Experience to improve an ability. It costs 30 Experience to raise an
                                                ability by one rank, and 30 Experience for each additional rank.
                                                So to improve Fighting 2 to Fighting 3, you would spend 30 Experience. To improve
                                                Fighting 2 to Fighting 4, you would spend 60 Experience.
                                                Improving an ability takes time and training. For every rank you would increase your
                                                ability, you must spend 1 week training under the tutelage of a character who has at
                                                least 1 rank higher than you in the
                                                ability you want to improve. You can still improve the ability without the trainer, but
                                                the time increases to 1+1d6/2 weeks.

                                            <p>The most expensive aspect of character improvement is the acquisition of Destiny Points.
                                                Once you acquire a Destiny Point, you may immediately invest it into a Benefit or erase
                                                a drawback as normal.

                                <h2>Glory</h2>
                                <p>Glory is the currency of the noble and is used to directly improve
                                        your family’s fortunes. Whenever you acquire Glory as a reward, you may invest that Glory into your family’s house by returning to your
                                        lands. You simply transfer the Glory to your house, dividing it up or
                                        investing it all in one or more of your house’s resources. The effect of
                                        accumulated Glory is far less immediate and may take time to realize
                                        its benefits.</p>
                                        <h4>Using Glory</h4>
                                        <p>Glory may be spent by characters, 1 point at a time, to gain +1B on any test. Bonus Dice gained from spending Glory may exceed the usual limits on Bonus Dice.</p>

                                        <p>A character can also donate
                                                Glory earned to their house, increasing any resource by 1 for each

                    <p>Specialties reflect a narrowing of a character's focus in a specific area of training.</p>
                    <p>As with Abilities, Specialties may have a rank from 1 to 7; however, unlike Abilities, all
                        Specialties start at Rank 0.</p>
                    <p>Your rank in a given Specialty may never exceed your rank in the governing Ability.</p>
                    <p>For each rank in a Specialty, you gain Bonus Dice when testing that Specialty. For example, if
                        you have trained Axes to Rank 2 (denoted Axes 2B), you would gain 2 bonus dice on a Fighting
                        test while using an Axe.<br />
                        You may only keep as many dice as your rank in the governing Ability. Using the previous
                        example, if you had Fighting 3, Axes 2B, you would roll a total of 5 dice (3 + 2B) for a test,
                        but only keep the 3 highest.</p>

                    <h4>Drawbacks</h4>
                    <p>Drawbacks are negative qualities, and confer negative effects or penalties. Generally, you may
                        only take a Drawback once.</p>
                    <p>If you voluntarily take a Drawback, you will gain 1 Destiny Point. You may not have more
                        Drawbacks than Benefits.</p>
                    <p>Characters who are Adults or older begin with one Drawback. Ordinarily, this is a Flaw, but may
                        be changed with permission of the Narrator.</p>
                    <p>The below list is not exhaustive. People in
                        Westeros and beyond seem ever inventive in finding new ways to be despicable.
                        If you’d like to explore some other dimension of human failing
                        not included here, work with your Narrator to come up with something
                        appropriate that’s a significant drawback.</p>

                    <p>Character creation is quite simple, but it is spread out over a number
                        of steps to help guide you through the process and avoid the inevitable
                        pitfalls that lay in wait.</p>

                    <p>If you and your fellow players are creating characters for the first time,
                        you create your family’s house and lands as a group first. If you
                        are creating a replacement character for a dead one or are joining an
                        established game, you use whatever the house the group is using.</p>
                    <p>If you have not yet created a house, find the steps <a href="./house.html#creation">here</a>.</p>

                    <h4 id="concept" class="info">Character Concept</h4>
                    <p>A Character's Concept includes their age and Status, as well as what drives them.</p>
                    <p>The components of the Concept are as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Status</li>
                            <li>Background</li>
                            <li>Goal</li>
                            <li>Motivation</li>
                            <li>Virtue</li>
                            <li>Vice</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Age and Status have mechanical repercussions, but the other components are largely narrative in
                        nature. If you need inspiration, rollable tables are included for those components. Otherwise,
                        work with the Narrator to determine each.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Age</strong></p>
                    <p>Roll on the table below, or choose an age for your character. Your character's age determines
                        their starting experience, the extent to which their Abilities can be trained at creation, as
                        well as their Destiny Points, Benefits, Drawbacks, and Flaws.</p>

                <p>With a clear idea of your character in mind, you’re ready to improve
                        your abilities. All characters begin with rank 2 in each ability. Using the

                        an ability by purchasing additional ranks. During this step, you must
                        <strong>spend all Ability Experience</strong>, and you must <strong>purchase your Status rank

                <p><a href="./character.html#destiny">Destiny Points</a> have many uses, as detailed in their specific section.</p>
                <p>One of the more important uses of Destiny Points is their ability to be invested into Benefits. Benefits generally fall into the same category as Feats or Talents from other game systems - that is to say, an expensive purchase that grants your character special abilities or enchances them beyond what would otherwise be possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your age determines how many Destiny Points you may have, as well as the maximum number of Benefits you may invest in. A character starts with a certain number of Destiny Points depending on their age. Younger Characters have more paths available to them, while those who have survived the trials and tribulations of life in Westeros have likely done so thanks to their own Destiny.</p>
                    <p>Note that if you invest a Destiny Point in a Benefit, you may not Spend or Burn that Destiny Point unless you forfeit that Benefit. As such, it may not be wise to invest all of your Destiny Points<br/>
                        For example, an Old character has 2 Destiny Points, and can take up to 2 Benefits. Doing so would leave him bereft of Destiny Points in the event he truly needs one.</p>
