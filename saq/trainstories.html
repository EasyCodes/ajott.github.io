								I legit don't think there are any, although I'm not an engineer. Even top spec trains
								have trouble with leaves, although much less so than older stock due to computerised
								wheel slip controls and sanding systems <br />
								<br />
								It may be of interest to note that it isn't leaves that are the problem in themselves;
								it's the oils released from some types of leaves after they are crushed. Hence the whole
								"wrong type of leaves" thing.<br />
								<br />
								So far as I can tell the best controls for that are just cutting back the damn trees,
								but then you have problems with the people who live nearby and the wildlife that lives,
								well, nearby too. Either way it is not really a safety issue anymore, it's primarily a
								performance issue now. Insert sex joke here.

								Okay, well let&#8217;s have a look at Cowden. A pretty minor incident in the great
								scheme of things, but one with several fascinating (terrifying) details.<br />
								<br />
								<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/H4KRJSz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crash
									pic</a><br />
								&#160;<br />
								Cowden station is on the Uckfield line in the south of England. &#160;This had
								previously been a two track line all the way to the south coast but in 1969 the through
								route was taken out. &#160;This meant decreasing passenger numbers. By 1988 the line was
								in terrible disrepair and it was felt the low demand didn&#8217;t justify much
								expenditure so the decision was taken to scrap one set of rails and just make it a
								single line that trains could go either direction on, with loops for trains to pass each
								other in certain stations. &#160;At the time the passenger group for the area said this
								was an accident waiting to happen.<br />
								<br />
								On 5th October 1994 Signaller Webb booked on at 06:50 at the Oxted box which controls
								the whole single line from Oxted to Uckfield. &#160;Everything was going fine until he
								set up all the signals for the Southbound 08:04 Oxted to Uckfield as far as Ashurst
								loop, about halfway down the single line section. &#160;He also setup the route for the
								Northbound 08:00 Uckfield to Oxted to the same point. This was all normal. The two
								trains go on single line sections as far as Ashurst where the track splits back into
								two. &#160;They pass each other, then they carry on down single line sections again. The
								northbound train gets there first and waits for the southbound to get out of the single
								line before the signaller can set the route for them to continue on.<br />
								<br />
								Signaller Webb set up these signals and then went to get his breakfast. &#160;But then
								he heard alarms going. He came back to his panel to see signal OD58, which was set to
								red to stop the northbound train going into the single line, had been passed. &#160;The
								points, which he had set for the southbound train leaving the single line, were
								&#8220;out of correspondence&#8221; &#8211; the northbound train had gone through them
								and knocked them out of the position they were set in. He telephoned route control to
								report the certain collision of the northbound and southbound trains. &#160;He recorded
								the time as 08:28 and setup up &#8220;collar&#8221; reminders on the signals to preserve
								evidence. <u>He did all this approximately two minutes before the collision occurred.
									&#160;He had no way of preventing it.</u><br />
								<br />
								There were no on train data recorders on either train, but we know that Driver Rees, who
								was driving the southbound train perfectly in accordance with all signals, applied the
								emergency brake shortly after leaving Cowden station. &#160;He then left the cab and ran
								through the engine compartment, where he was later found crushed to death. It was
								estimated from where he was found he probably left his seat 5 seconds before the crash,
								in which he was completely blameless. &#160;No one else on his train was killed,
								although the Guard was sufficiently shaken and disoriented that despite getting out and
								walking the length of the full crash site he wasn&#8217;t aware another train was
								involved. On reaching the rear of the train his had collided with he thought that he was
								just at the front of his own train, and was confused about why the cab was empty. He was
								the only member of staff present to survive.<br />
								<br />
								The bodies of both Driver Barton and Guard Brett-Andrews were later found in the cab of
								the northbound train, crushed between the front of the cab of the southbound train and
								the roof of their own cab. It was not possible from their positioning or their injuries
								to determine who had been in the driving seat at the time. &#160;Obviously, it should
								have been the actual driver &#8211; Brian Barton, but the guard shouldn&#8217;t even
								have been in the cab at all as he had no reason to be there. Two other passengers in the
								front of the northbound train, Mr and Mrs Pointer, were thrown out of the wreckage and
								killed.<br />
								<br />
								So why did the northbound train, whoever was driving it, pass OD58 when it was showing
								red? We only have conjecture to go on. &#160;It was a very foggy morning. The line was
								known to be bad for that. What do you do as a driver if the fog is so bad you
								can&#8217;t see very far? &#160;You have to know the line very well and know where the
								signals are. It was estimated that at the speed the train was probably travelling and
								with that level of visibility the driver had roughly one second in which OD58 would have
								been visible. &#160;If you know to look out at that point you are probably fine. Driver
								Barton was reasonably experienced. If Guard Brett-Andrews was driving chances are he
								would not have known how to deal with the situation. Even if Brett-Andrews wasn&#8217;t
								driving his presence would certainly have been a distraction, which is why it was
								prohibited in the first place. <br />
								<br />
								It may seem strange that a guard might have been driving, but it was at one point
								thoroughly commonplace for rules like that to be flouted. &#160;Most drivers would have
								once been other train crew &#8211; guards, &#8220;second men&#8221;, &#8220;train
								men&#8221;. It follows a lot of other train crew had ambitions to become drivers.
								&#160;Brett-Andrews had been reprimanded twice officially for being in the cab of trains
								when he shouldn&#8217;t have been. It is widely rumoured that Brett-Andrews frequently
								drove trains. &#160;No one would officially testify to that, so no conclusion was
								reached. This was probably the tail end of guards driving trains being a common thing
								anyway, but one of the unofficial consequences of this accident was that it pretty much
								killed that practice off.<br />
								<br />
								Ultimately whether Guard Brett-Andrews was driving or Driver Barton was driving it was
								the driver who had the responsibility in that situation. &#160;It would have been the
								driver who let the guard drive, after all. If the guard was driving you would still
								expect the driver to be monitoring for signals. Even if the guard wasn&#8217;t driving
								and just causing a distraction it was the driver who had the responsibility to tell him
								to leave the cab. &#160;Officially Brian Barton was found to be the sole person
								responsible for the accident.<br />
								<br />
								<b>What did we learn?</b><br />
								<br />
								<i>Trains should have radios</i>. It seems terrifying to think it took until the 90s to
								reach this conclusion. &#160;Before this most communication was by SPT &#8211; Signal
								Post Telephone, i.e. a telephone screwed to each signal. &#160;But that can only be
								initiated one way; by the driver stopping to use it. The signaller had no way of
								stopping trains other than by using signals, and if drivers did not respond to those
								they were stumped. &#160;Signaller Webb knew an almost certainly fatal accident would
								occur almost two minutes before it actually happened. Now all trains have radios.
								Signallers can send emergency stop messages to all trains, at all times, and so can
								other drivers if they have to.<br />
								<br />
								<i>People being in the cab with the driver is a distraction.</i> &#160;It was already
								against the rules for the Guard to be in the cab for no reason. &#160;Following this
								accident employers were told to get strict about enforcing this. Cab Passes were
								introduced to control access to cabs for people other than crew, like trainers,
								assessors, and technical staff.<br />
								<br />
								<i>TPWS</i>. It is not a direct consequence of this accident but it would have been
								completely prevented by Train Protection Warning System (TPWS), which is now installed
								at all conflict points. &#160;When a signal is red a grid on the track picks up if a
								train has passed the signal and automatically sends a signal to apply the brakes.<br />
								<br />
								<i>Track layout</i>. There is now a very thorough risk assessment process when a line is
								resignalled. &#160;The obvious dangers of having trains run head to head on single
								lines, protected only by signals would now be highlighted at a design stage. &#160;This
								was in fact introduced following the Clapham Junction crash of 12th December 1988, but
								the Uckfield line had already been resignalled by then. &#160;The official report into
								the Cowden crash recommended drawing up a plan to conduct those risk assessments
								retrospectively for lines that had been missed.<br />
								<br />
								Could it happen in the UK now? &#160;Probably not.<br />

								It seemed well received so I&#8217;ll have a look at explaining Clapham Junction now.
								&#160;This one is a biggy so I think I&#8217;ll split it up. To really get the gist of
								what went wrong its worth going into a bit of detail about the basics of how signalling
								works.<br />
								<br />
								The safety of UK railways is founded almost entirely on track circuit block and distance
								interval working. &#160;The basic principles of that are sound and allow trains to
								travel at high speeds extremely closely to each other with pretty much no prospect of
								any accident. &#160;At Clapham the basic principles of track circuit block went badly
								wrong.<br />
								<br />
								When the railway was new safety was governed by time interval working, i.e. only a
								period of time separated trains. &#160;A train went along the track, a period of time
								was measured, then another train went along the track, and so on. You can see the
								problem. &#160;There was no method of any kind to communicate with the trains. So no one
								knew what had happened to that first train. It could have reached its destination hours
								ago and still no one knew. &#160;Or everyone involved could have been killed and no one
								knew. The time was measured, and the next train was sent. <br />
								<br />
								If that sounds like an incredibly dangerous way of working that&#8217;s because it was.
								&#160;But don&#8217;t worry &#8211; you were much more likely to be killed by the basic
								technical problems on the engines themselves causing massive explosions than by them
								ever crashing into each other. &#160;So that&#8217;s nice.<br />
								<br />
								Distance interval working was considerably safer. &#160;A measure of distance rather
								than time was used to separate trains. &#160;The train was sent, you waited until
								confirmation it had reached the next station, then the next train went. &#160;This
								required communication. Eventually it developed into signallers and signal boxes. Each
								signal box was responsible for one bit of track. &#160;They observed the train arrive
								and told the previous signal box it was there safely, and therefore crucially had
								vacated the track between the boxes. &#160;Then they asked the next signal box for
								permission to let the train proceed and if they received confirmation the track ahead
								was clear, they sent the train on its way. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								This, incidentally, is why trains have red lights on the rear. &#160;Only by observing
								the red lights did the signaller know the whole train had arrived and that no divided
								coaches had been left in the section. <br />
								<br />
								So we had distance interval working and absolute block sections &#8211; the railway was
								divided into sections and if a train was still in a section the next train wasn&#8217;t
								allowed to enter. &#160;The next step was track circuit block, which we still use for
								the most part. This involves an electrical current running through the tracks and
								connected to the signal &#8211; a track circuit. &#160;If that circuit has power the
								green light on the associated signal was lit and trains could enter that section of
								track. If that circuit lost power, i.e. because train wheels on the track shorted it
								out, the red signal was lit and trains were therefore told they had no permission to
								enter that section because it was still occupied. &#160;That means every train would be
								automatically protected in the rear by a red light by very straightforward electrical
								circuits. In theory.<br />
								<br />
								The only thing to then be added was cautionary aspects where necessary. &#160;If a
								signal was red the signal ahead automatically turned to single yellow, which warned the
								driver to begin braking. &#160;If you have four aspect signalling the signal ahead of
								the single yellow displayed two yellows &#8211; prelimary caution. This means drivers no
								longer have to be able to react and stop in only a sightlines distance, they can reduce
								their speed miles before needing to stop because they have been warned of the
								approaching red signal several signals beforehand. This allows trains to run closer
								together at higher speeds.<br />
								<br />
								That is no doubt not entirely accurate as a historical picture. &#160;But it gives the
								rough direction of how and why things have developed in the way they have.<br />
								<br />
								On Monday 12th December 1988 several drivers on the northbound approach to Clapham
								Junction say signal WF138 changed as they approached it. &#160;This isn&#8217;t unusual
								in itself. If the train ahead is moving forward you would expect track circuits to
								become clear as the train moves, causing signals to go from red to yellow, etc.
								&#160;However many of them saw it go from green to double yellow, or double to single
								yellow. None reported it. There were plausible explanations in their minds for every
								change, for instance the signaller could have routed a train ahead of them somewhere.
								&#160;The rule book at the time was very vague and only said they had to report
								irregularities that could be a danger to another train. As they all had reasonable
								stories in their heads for the change the prospect of danger to trains wasn&#8217;t
								obvious.<br />
								<br />
								However eventually Driver McClymont on the train from Basingstoke witnessed signal WF138
								turn from single yellow to red in front of them. &#160;They were unable to stop and went
								past it. This was a signal passed at danger, even if it wasn&#8217;t his fault, so he
								had to report it immediately. He stopped the train at the next signal, WF47 &#8211; the
								last signal before Clapham Junction station, to use the Signal Post Telephone and report
								it to Signaller Cotter at the Clapham Junction signal box. &#160;WF138 then changed back
								to single yellow, despite the presence of the Basingstoke train on the track circuit
								controlling it.<br />
								<br />
								Driver John Rolls on the service from Poole was driving normally to the signals he saw
								and approaching Clapham Junction at about 60mph. &#160;There was no data recorder on the
								train but an off duty driver was sitting in the back cab, which also has a live brake
								gauge and speedometer. &#160;The off duty driver saw the brake gauge go into emergency
								for a few seconds, and estimated the speed was about 35mph when the Poole train hit the
								Basingstoke train in a rear end collision. <br />
								<br />
								Driver Rolls was killed along with 32 of the passengers sitting in the front three
								coaches. &#160;69 people were seriously injured, two of whom later died from their
								injuries. 415 people suffered minor injuries. The first coach was subject to what the
								later report described as &#8220;complete disintegration&#8221;, and the following two
								coaches derailed. To make matters worse a set of empty coaching stock coming from
								Clapham on the adjacent line then struck the wreckage and also derailed.
								&#160;It&#8217;s not clear if this directly killed or injured anyone, but it definitely
								didn&#8217;t help.<br />
								<br />
								Driver Pike on the train following Driver Rolls saw the wreckage ahead a few minutes
								later and applied the emergency brakes. &#160;He estimated he stopped 20 metres from the
								crash but it was later measured as more like 60. He walked back to signal WF138, which
								he had passed at proceed, and saw it was still displaying a single yellow, despite the
								presence now of three trains in total on the track circuit controlling it. &#160;He
								reported this to Signaller Cotter quite forcefully.<br />
								<br />
								The signal box was examined later that day and it was found that the electrical relay
								for the track circuit for signal WF138 had an extraneous section of wire. &#160;This had
								intermittently connected current to the circuit when it should have been shorted, so it
								was still able to show proceed aspects despite the track circuit being occupied.
								&#160;Post two on how that wire came to be there.

								Part 2 on Clapham Junction:<br />
								<br />
								The wiring on the relays had been put in by a signalling technician called Brian
								Hemingway two weeks before the crash. &#160;This was part of the Waterloo Area
								Resignalling Scheme (WARS), which had been planned and implemented from 1978 onwards.
								&#160;Waterloo is the busiest London rail terminal, as anyone who has watched the
								opening scenes of The Bourne Ultimatum knows (it&#8217;s the place where Paddy Considine
								gets shot). &#160;Clapham Junction is a major station on approach to Waterloo where the
								lines from Windsor, Wessex, and Sussex all join. It still proudly boasts it has the
								largest number of passenger interchanges per day in the whole of Europe.<br />
								<br />
								The signalling for this whole area hadn&#8217;t been renovated since 1936. &#160;By 1978
								the situation was bad. By 1988 it was desperate. So WARS was being implemented rapidly.
								&#160;This involved replacing and re-numbering a large number of signals, including WA25
								which was to become WF138. This was done by Brian Hemingway on Saturday 27th November
								1988. &#160;He put in the new wires but did not take out one of the old ones. &#160;He
								just cut it at one end &#8211; still attached at the other. He did not put insulating
								tape around the loose end, he just pushed it out of the way of the circuit.<br />
								<br />
								This was surprisingly not a problem until two weeks later on, Sunday 11th December, when
								a wiring job was required, again as part of WARS, on the relay next to this one in the
								relay room. &#160;This disturbed the WF138 wire and allowed it to contact the circuit at
								its un-insulated end again. By chance the person conducting this work was Brian
								Hemingway again. &#160;On the following Monday morning, when the line was reopened, the
								signal displayed green or red entirely independently of what the track circuit was doing
								and instead dependent on whether the wire was making contact in the relay. &#160;For the
								early morning the train service was infrequent and even though the aspects were wrong
								there was sufficient space between trains that no crash was possible. When rush hour
								started the trains bunched up and it was only a matter of time before a proceed was
								shown when a train was physically stopped on that circuit. &#160;So the accident
								happened shortly after 8am. For this very reason the trains were also carrying more
								people. Over 1500 passengers were on Driver Rolls&#8217; train from Poole.<br />
								<br />
								Why did Brian Hemingway do the wiring job this badly? Some of the mistakes were ones it
								was later found he always made. &#160;Some were ones he made only the day and
								couldn&#8217;t account for.<br />
								<br />
								He was asked why he hadn&#8217;t removed the old wire. &#160;His answer was he never did
								that. Not only that, no one who did the same job did that either, so far as he knew.
								&#160;He had never been trained to do that. He had never been questioned by an assessor
								or supervisor for not doing that. &#160;The importance of doing so was not clear to
								signalling technicians across the board. Anyone could have been doing that job on 27th
								November and made the same mistake, which is why the inquiry did not find him at fault
								despite that in his evidence he claimed full responsibility.<br />
								<br />
								His training had been on the job. &#160;He&#8217;d been working for British Rail for
								years. &#160;Whilst new signalling technicians had a training course when they joined
								the older ones had not been put on it. Following a series of signal irregularities a few
								years before an instruction had gone out from BR Standards head office that all
								signalling jobs must include a count of wires left to ensure all the old ones had been
								removed. &#160;No one could demonstrate that Hemingway would ever have seen this. Even
								senior managers responsible for WARS weren&#8217;t aware this was an instruction. They
								thought it was a consultation paper, and did not distribute it to staff. In fact, as
								they thought it was a consulation paper they wrote back their disagreement with it and
								left it at that. &#160;No one from Standards followed it up.<br />
								<br />
								Then there is the issue of his supervision. &#160;His supervisor on the day was Derek
								Bumstead, and the testing engineer was Peter Dray. &#160;Derek Bumstead turned out to be
								supervising in name only as he wasn&#8217;t present. Signalling and Telecomms (S&T) were
								short staffed so he was actually at another site working with a gang on the tracks.
								&#160;That was his style of management. He liked to muck in and help. Neither Hemingway
								or Bumstead had any expectation that Bumstead would check the work in the relay room.
								Peter Dray was responsible on paper for conducting testing for this area, but as WARS
								was a special project it wasn&#8217;t clear to him he was responsible for that work as
								well. &#160;A number of management reorganisations over the years had left it very
								unclear who was conducting quality assurance for what. It was inevitable stuff would get
								missed eventually.<br />
								<br />
								So we come to the peculiar errors, like the lack of insulating tape. &#160;Hemingway
								reported he always used tape and had no idea why he hadn&#8217;t in this case.
								&#160;Remember I said he did the work on both Sunday 11th December and Saturday 27th
								November? &#160;Well in fact he had worked every day in between. &#160;Not only that, he
								had worked all but one day in the preceding three months. &#160;Out of 91 days he had
								worked 90 of them. A survey of technicians in his grade demonstrated that nearly a third
								had in fact worked every day over that period, and another third took one day off on
								average every two weeks. The pay wasn&#8217;t great so there was a large number of
								people who would do every hour of overtime they could. <br />
								<br />
								This was in fact common across most grades. &#160;My uncle was a signaller in the 1980s
								and he tells stories now of regularly working nightshifts and getting a call towards the
								end of it asking if he could come back to cover a late shift just a few hours later.
								&#160;So he would go home, take my cousins to school, sleep for 2 or 3 hours, then go
								back to work in the signal box. One of the driving instructors I learnt with had been a
								driver for nearly 40 years. In the 1980s he said he would quite commonly not go home for
								2-3 days at a time. &#160;He would drive trains, then sleep on a sofa in the messroom
								for a few hours, then drive trains again. There was no point even leaving the depot.
								<br />
								<br />
								Local management were asked why they were running their staff into the ground like this.
								The answer was they were running out of time to get WARS done. &#160;It had been on the
								cards since 1978 but the planning for the actual wiring work for this stage of it
								wasn&#8217;t done until 1986. But even this meant the plan for what work would be done
								on what days was drawn up two years before the work happened. &#160;In that time staff
								levels changed, so to keep up they just offered more and more overtime to those who were
								left. Senior British Rail managers expressed shock and dismay, as all senior managers do
								in these circumstances, that those on the rung down could possibly have thought the
								project completion date was such an immovable deadline. &#160;I cannot roll my eyes hard
								enough at that. The fact of the matter was the railway ran on overtime. The railway ran
								on fatigue.<br />
								<br />
								<b>What did we learn?</b><br />
								<br />
								<i>Fatigue</i>. This is the biggy. The inquiry into the disaster churned out
								recommendation after recommendation concerning crash worthiness, assurance, training,
								and risk assessment. In the middle of the 250 page report were just two sentences that
								basically changed the way the railways run. They required managers to monitor and
								account for all excessive working by staff. <br />
								<br />
								This may not seem like much but the industry grabbed it with both hands. It's hard to
								think of anything more influential in the last 50 years in its scope. The report was
								written by Anthony Hidden, and even now the rules regarding working time on the railways
								are called the Hidden regulations, or even just "Hidden" (as in "that's a breach of
								Hidden" or "what does Hidden say about that?"). <br />
								<br />
								The rules are: <br />
								<br />
								1. No more than 12 hours in a shift. <br />
								2. No more than 72 hours in any 7 day period <br />
								3. At least 12 hours rest before any safety critical shift. <br />
								4. No more than 13 days out of 14.<br />
								<br />
								In actual fact these aren't even rules. In line with the rather mild tone of the
								recommendation they are at best guidelines. They can be breached if a manager is
								comfortable documenting and explaining the requirement to do so. Most railway staff
								don't understand it that way. It's become so embedded in railway culture that these are
								seen by most as hard and fast rules. Even those needing cash desperately won't bypass
								these guidelines for the most part. <br />
								<br />
								<i>Signal irregularities</i>. Drivers are required to carry the RT3185 form at all
								times. In the event of a signal irregularity, which is now more clearly defined, they
								stop and call the signaller. The signaller and driver fill the form out together on the
								phone and both submit it to their managers. Certain types of failure are investigated
								immediately by technicians on the ground. Until they are satisfied train movements are
								heavily restricted. This is why signal failures are a massive pain in the arse from a
								delay point of view. <br />
								<br />
								I will try and grab some photos and the report link asap. I appreciate that people find
								this interesting. I do too. I'm a fun guy at parties.

								I look at that and if no one was pointing it out I wouldn't even know what was wrong.
								Sadly that was also the situation Hemingway was in, to some extent. <br />
								<br />
								One of the reports other conclusions was that it is management responsibility to ensure
								everyone is adequately trained and assessed for the job they are asked to do. That's
								actually the bit I feel we've had biggest rollback on as in some grades the
								responsibility to make sure you're adequately trained has fallen back on the staff
								again.

								27th October last year a high speed train left Faversham in Kent for St Pancras at
								14:59, got up to 90mph line speed, then hit a van on a level crossing at 15:02.
								&#160;The van driver was seriously injured but no one else was hurt. The investigation
								highlighted systematic errors in the way some types of level crossings are
								managed.<br />
								<br />
								Frognal Farm crossing is a &#8220;User Worked Crossing&#8221; (UWC). &#160;It is on
								someone&#8217;s property, not a public highway. The risk assessments and control
								arrangements are a hangover from a Victorian era railway where a lot of this stuff was
								part of agreements between the railway companies and the farmers who&#8217;s land the
								railway had to run through. &#160;Essentially the &#8220;User&#8221; &#8211; the owner
								of the farm &#8211; is responsible for effectively briefing people on how to use the
								crossing. The accident highlighted that this was no longer a sensible way to do things,
								and in fact had probably always been pretty ineffective.<br />
								<br />
								UWC&#8217;s have a phone and a gate on either side of the crossing. &#160;To go across
								you use the phone to contact the signaller and ask for permission. &#160;They grant
								permission, or not, then you cross the tracks and phone them back to tell them the line
								is clear. There are signs explaining this but principally the safety arrangements hinge
								on the fact that there is generally only one or two people using the crossing and they
								know what they are doing. <br />
								<br />
								As of April 2017 POGO (power operated gate opening) equipment was installed on the
								crossing. &#160;The reason for this is obvious when you see the sequence of events the
								user had to follow to cross with a vehicle. &#160;The number in brackets is the number
								of times the user has to cross the tracks:<br />
								<br />
								Telephone the signaller<br />
								<br />
								Open the gate on your side<br />
								<br />
								Walk across and open the gate on the other side (1)<br />
								<br />
								Walk back and get your vehicle (2)<br />
								<br />
								Drive across in your vehicle (3)<br />
								<br />
								Walk back and close the first gate (4)<br />
								<br />
								Walk back to your vehicle, closing the last gate (5)<br />
								<br />
								Phone the signaller back<br />
								<br />
								So you needed to cross the tracks 5 times just to go from one side to the other with a
								tractor. &#160;This multiplies the time taken, and therefore the risk of a collision
								with a train. The POGO system means you press a button, both gates open, you drive over
								once, then you press the button on the other wide and both gates close.<br />
								<br />
								Crucially the POGO system is completely independent of the call to the signaller. You
								press the button, the gates open. &#160;That&#8217;s all it does.<br />
								<br />
								The guy in the van was a delivery driver. &#160;His prior experience of level crossings
								was that of a normal road user, i.e. if the barrier is open it is safe to cross.
								&#160;He first went to the wrong address and was given directions. Those directions
								included the fact that he had to use Frognal Farm crossing, and the instruction that he
								had to use a button to get the gates to open. There was a sign at the level crossing
								that said he had to use the phone, but it was next to a sign telling people you needed
								to press the button to open the gate. &#160;He pressed the button, the gate opened, and
								the van driver believed it was therefore safe to cross. So he did, and was immediately
								hit by a train travelling 90mph.<br />
								<br />
								The POGO system was installed as a team at Network Rail had been given a budget to
								reduce risk at crossings. &#160;They had considered getting rid of Frognal Farm and
								installing a bridge, or a tunnel. Both those suggestions were too expensive.
								&#160;Installing POGO was cheap, but allowed the budget to be spent and the risk to be
								reduced on paper. It all stinks of box ticking for the sake of it.<br />
								<br />
								By installing the POGO to reduce risks the level crossing team had in fact increased the
								risk. &#160;They had only considered usage of the crossing by the occupier of the land,
								who could reasonably be expected to already understand the principal of needing to
								contact the signaller. &#160;They had not factored in the impact this equipment, and the
								signage necessary for it, would have on other users. <br />
								<br />
								The accident investigation concluded that Network Rail should give better training to
								staff to identify risks and propose mitigation measures that take into account the
								actual circumstances of the location and the people likely to be involved. &#160;POGO
								was an &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; project, with an off the shelf generic risk
								assessment not specific to Frognal Farm. The learnings are therefore not specific to
								Frognal Farm, or even to level crossings, and could probably be reasonably applied
								outside the railway too. &#160;<br />

								That's basically an "Automatic Half Barrier" crossing, which is quite common but also
								involves a shit load more money. They use a treadle on the tracks to gauge when a train
								is coming. Crossings with this level of traffic don't justify the maintenance expense I
								think.

								I appreciate the feedback everyone. &#160;I&#8217;ll keep going because it seems well
								received. &#160;I wanted to write a bit about another relatively recent one that was
								talked about quite widely within the industry at the time, at least in this
								country.<br />
								<br />
								22nd January 2014 a group of three ultrasonic rail testers who were all very experienced
								turned up to perform a test on Newark South Junction, 70 meters south of Newark North
								Gate station (Newark England, not Newark New Jersey, sorry). One was assigned as
								&#8220;Controller of Site Safety&#8221; (COSS), one was doing the testing, and a man
								called John Wright was assigned as lookout. &#160;The COSS stayed in the van the three
								had arrived in. <br />
								<br />
								A few minutes after they arrived, at 11:34, the 10:08 London to Newark North Gate train
								approached the junction. &#160;The driver saw the track workers and blew the warning
								horn. Wright and the tester moved to a position of safety away from the tracks and both
								raised an arm to acknowledge the warning. &#160;Then 12 seconds later, for some reason,
								Wright turned away from the train and walked back to roughly where they had been
								standing. The train driver blew the horn again and applied the emergency brakes but
								Wright did not react until too late and was hit by the train. &#160;They were seriously
								injured and died 9 days later in hospital.<br />
								<br />
								There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here. Why was the COSS not on site? &#160;Why were they
								working on running lines in the first place? And obviously, the big question, why did
								John Wright walk into the path of a train he had only just acknowledged?<br />
								<br />
								The Network Rail works planner back in Doncaster depot was the person responsible for
								drawing up the &#8220;Safe System of Work&#8221; that would allow the ultrasonic rail
								testing to be done. They have a number of different categories of system to choose from
								ranging from the safest &#8220;green zone&#8221; working (lines closed, no train
								movements) to the least safe &#8220;red zone&#8221; working (all lines open, trains
								running normally on all lines, workers protected by lookouts). &#160;If the work is
								lengthy and complicated and requires a big work gang they are likely to choose a more
								restrictive method of work like arranging a &#8220;possession&#8221; of the track and
								creating a green zone. Normally the signaller is considered to be the owner of a section
								of line. If the track workers have a possession it means the signaller is temporarily
								not in control of movements in that area and therefore cannot run trains through it. You
								might do that for major works, but it is not always considered feasible for routine
								testing.<br />
								<br />
								After the accident Network Rail provided figures that showed 95% of the testing work
								from that region was red zone work. Red zone working should only be used if no other
								system was feasible. The investigation concluded that &#8220;flexibility&#8221; had
								taken priority over this instruction at the Doncaster depot.<br />
								<br />
								All three members of the gang were competent to act as COSS or lookout. &#160;Whoever is
								assigned as COSS for the day is responsible for assessing the Safe System of Work and
								making sure it&#8217;s appropriate. &#160;It isn&#8217;t possible to do that from your
								van. The COSS is responsible for briefing the gang on features of the site, which would
								include in what directions trains travel on each line (more on this later). This was
								done while they were in the van on the way to the site according to the surviving two.
								So the COSS hadn&#8217;t assessed the site before giving the briefing. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								The most junior member of the gang, the tester, had 13 years of experience. &#160;The
								most senior, the COSS, had 36 years experience. John Wright had 30 years. &#160;They had
								all worked frequently at Newark in the past. Perhaps nothing would have been done
								especially differently if the COSS had been on site, assessed the SSOW, and then given
								their briefing. &#160;But the whole thing suggests an air of complacency about the risks
								of what they were doing. All of these procedures, processes, and qualifications are
								there as mitigation for the risks involved in the choice by the planner to have this
								work conducted in the most dangerous out of all the available options.<br />
								<br />
								Why did John Wright walk into the path of the train? &#160;Unfortunately his injuries
								precluded him giving an explanation. &#160;Newark has a southbound line, a northbound
								line and a bay platform. &#160;Newark South junction is where trains cross from the
								northbound line to the bay platform, crossing over the southbound line. &#160;The two
								workers were working on the southbound line, walked away from the tracks, then Wright
								turned towards the station and walked onto the southbound tracks again. &#160;If the
								train had been going into the northbound platform 1 he would have been safe. In fact it
								was crossing over the southbound lines to go into platform 3. Presumably he was not
								aware of this. It was still approaching the junction when he moved away and acknowledged
								it, so its eventual route wasn&#8217;t obvious. &#160;He did not look back in the
								direction of the train until roughly 1 second before the impact.<br />
								<br />
								The most likely explanation is that Wright assumed the southbound line was not affected
								by the trains&#8217; movement, and due to complacency about his knowledge of the
								location he did not think to look. &#160;To me it seems like low levels of situational
								awareness, or autopilot. Like when you drive home and get there and realise you
								can&#8217;t remember any of the journey. I doubt he consciously thought to himself at
								any point &#8220;that train&#8217;s going into platform 1, so the southbound line is
								clear&#8221;. &#160;He probably just acted on instinct/autopilot/preconditioning and
								didn&#8217;t even think about it. We all do that all the time, we&#8217;re just not
								normally in an environment where it can kill you. <br />
								<br />
								Examining Wright&#8217;s training and assessment history it seemed he had been badly let
								down in recent years by those supposed to be looking out for him. &#160;Incidents had
								happened and never been documented. He&#8217;d been doing the job so long no one really
								considered the possibility of skill fade over time. People don&#8217;t generally
								consciously note moving from a &#8220;normal&#8221; mental state to a
								&#8220;concentrating&#8221; mental state. &#160;But sometimes you need to make a
								decision to flick a switch in your head, or put your game face on. It&#8217;s what we
								now refer to as &#8220;non-technical skills&#8221;. A constant program of assessment,
								monitoring, briefings, and professional discussions can help to foreground in
								people&#8217;s minds that what they are dealing with can kill them.

								Thanks. I will try and write something about Ladbroke Grove next as its a really big
								deal. Like Clapham Junction it has had a massive impact. You can still get killed on the
								railway easily enough but it's hard to imagine something like that happening again. Our
								biggest risk these days is probably rear end collisions or a Germanwings style "I'm
								going down and I'm taking you all with me".<br />
								<br />
								It's conceivable weve already had one of those actually - the Moorgate crash.

								The Ladbroke Grove crash was I think the most recent really major rail accident in this
								country. &#160;At 08:06 on 5th October 1999 Driver Michael Hodder took a 3 car
								&#8220;Turbo&#8221; service for Bedwyn out of Paddington. &#160;He got up to about 46mph
								and reacted appropriately to first a double yellow, then a single yellow aspect,
								reducing speed to about 40mph. &#160;Then he encountered a red on signal SN109. He
								passed the signal at danger at 08:08. After about 600 meters the points were set to take
								him onto the Up Main line. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								Unlike Signaller Webb in the Cowden incident of 1994 the signallers in the Slough box in
								1999 had the capacity to send an emergency stop message to Hodder. &#160;They had
								approximately 12 seconds between the notification on their panel that SN109 had been
								passed and the point where Hodder would not reasonably have been able to react to stop
								from fouling the Up Main. &#160;They did not do so. Their evidence as to why they did
								not was confused and contradictory between the four of them on duty. The signaller
								sitting at the panel changed his story several times over the course of the inquiry.
								&#160;It seems the danger to other trains was not immediately obvious to them and
								reading between the lines they panicked. They placed the signal on the Up Main, SN120,
								to danger to attempt to stop the approaching train on that line. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								SN120 changed to red about 200 &#8211; 250 mtrs in front of the approaching train on the
								Up Main, a 1968 built &#8220;HST&#8221; (High Speed Train) from Cheltenham to
								Paddington, being driven at nearly 100mph by Brian Cooper. &#160;Cooper had applied the
								emergency brakes, as did Hodder, but this had little effect on the crash, which occurred
								at a combined collision speed of 130mph. <br />
								<br />
								Both drivers were instantly killed. &#160;29 other people also died, 6 on the HST and 23
								on the Turbo. Both trains were diesel powered and several fuel tanks ruptured.
								&#160;Many survivors were trapped in wreckage, sprayed with diesel fuel, then set on
								fire. Fucking. Yikes. The report describes the injuries sustained in terms ranging from
								&#8220;serious&#8221; through &#8220;significant&#8221; all the way up to
								&#8220;horrific&#8221;. &#160;Most of the dead were killed by the impact, but one
								passenger in the Turbo died from burns sustained after two weeks in hospital, and one
								passenger was found under the train having died from &#8220;traumatic
								asphyxiation&#8221;. Jesus Christ. If I ever get a choice could you mark me down for
								just the regular kind of asphyxiation please.<br />
								<br />
								Passengers injuries were made worse as some weren&#8217;t able to get out of the
								wreckage. &#160;Carriages of the HST had been turned over and passengers struggled to
								use the emergency hammers to break windows that were now their only exit. &#160;Due to a
								history of vandalism the hammers had been removed entirely from the Turbo and passengers
								were fortunate that there was a trainee driver travelling on board who was able to let
								them out via the rear cab. There were a total of 570 people involved, of whom 523 were
								recorded as injured in some way.<br />
								<br />
								So yeah, I can understand why people took the bus for a while after this one. &#160;It
								was a political shit storm that put terms like SPAD (signal passed at danger) and TPWS
								(Train Protection Warning System) into the public eye in a big way. There are three
								factors that are worth thinking about in relation to it; SN109, Michael Hodder, and the
								concept of flank protection. I will try and write about each of those but fair warning
								it may have to wait until next week.

								Sorry for the break, back to Ladbroke Grove, Michael Hodder, and SN 109 signal.<br />
								<br />
								The whole area on approach to Paddington had been completely resignalled in the early
								1990s. The new layout consisted of 6 lines, all of which were bidirectional. As there
								was limited room for signals to be mounted in posts trackside the signals were placed
								side by side on gantries above the line. This is pretty common for busy areas like this,
								although it caused significant problems at Paddington.<br />
								<br />
								SN109 had been passed at danger (&#8220;SPADed&#8221;) 8 times in the 6 years since
								it&#8217;s installation and prior to when Hodder passed it and collided with the
								oncoming HST. This is stunningly high risk. The official report into the crash, the
								Cullen report, commissioned a statistical analysis of events at SN109 and found there
								was an 86% chance of at least one SPAD at SN109 in any given year. &#160;Taking into
								accounts the train movements involved it was estimated there was a 7% chance of a
								collision in any given year, or one collision on average every 14 years. In the end it
								only took 6.<br />
								<br />
								When the new lines were designed in 1989 it was considered crucial that line speeds of
								100mph be attainable. &#160;However, this then dictated the spacing between signals
								quite strictly, as it is necessary that there be sufficient space between signals for
								all types of traction to brake at them. This was in central London, so in general there
								was very little space to position things as you would like. &#160;The combination of
								these factors meant the position of signal gantries was pretty much set in stone from a
								very early point.<br />
								<br />
								We have signal sighting standards that dictate how long a driver should have to view and
								respond to a signal. &#160;It must be clearly visible for a minimum amount of time. When
								you combine this with the linespeed you get a strict distance at which a signal has to
								come into view, and then stay in view unobstructed. These figures change from time to
								time but are generally now around 7-8 seconds, depending on the risk associated with the
								signal. <br />
								<br />
								After the signalling had been put in during the Paddington remodel it became quickly
								clear that all signals on gantry number 8, including SN109 in the middle of it, were
								obscured until you were very close as there was a roadbridge right in front of the
								gantry. &#160;It was not compliant with signal sighting standards. However the bridge
								was not going to move and the gantry&#8217;s position was dictated by other factors. So
								the basic problem was, within the parameters the technicians were given, effectively
								insurmountable.<br />
								<br />
								Quickly the design of the gantry was changed. The cages the signals were mounted in were
								lowered, however they couldn&#8217;t be lowered until the entire signal was visible as
								then there would be no clearance for trains to run underneath them. &#160;So the problem
								of sighting distance noncompliance was &#8220;solved&#8221; with a design noncompliance
								&#8211; all signals on the gantry were changed to a &#8220;reverse L&#8221; shape.
								<br />
								<br />
								4 Aspect signalling has to be able to show four different messages to the driver &#8211;
								green, double yellow, yellow, and red. &#160;Modern LED signals can now do this with two
								physical apertures, but colour light signals from 20 years ago required four apertures.
								&#160;These are always positioned in a straight line like a traffic light, in the top to
								bottom order of yellow, green, yellow, red. The red is at the bottom as it is closest to
								the drivers eyeline. All the signals at gantry 8 were changed so from top to bottom they
								were yellow, green, yellow, and then the red was positioned adjacent to the bottom
								yellow on it&#8217;s left &#8211; a reverse L.<br />
								<br />
								This was completely non-standard but because it reduced the height of the signal it
								allowed the whole of it to be visible under the roadbridge from a greater distance.
								<br />
								<br />
								Driving a train and approaching a gantry is not really like driving a car and
								approaching traffic lights. &#160;All the lines look the same. All the signals look the
								same. Imagine driving a car on a featureless road in one of the middle lanes out of 6.
								&#160;You come to a junction with 6 traffic lights, all but one are red and one in the
								middle is green. You have to react while the lights are still in the distance. Is your
								signal green or red? &#160;The confusion is exacerbated if the gantry is on a curve as
								you may be closer to a signal that doesn&#8217;t apply to your line for most of the
								approach. In practice drivers generally count from the right or the left. &#160;That may
								seem easy but it cuts into reaction times. Multiple signals next to each other are a
								known risk.<br />
								<br />
								The nonstandard shape didn&#8217;t help as it essentially meant that when the signal was
								red there were no lights illuminated at all within the vertical shape normally expected
								by drivers. In my view the drivers were being preconditioned to ignore red aspects here.
								&#160;Not a problem if you are concentrating and know what to expect, but some lapses of
								focus are inevitable.<br />
								<br />
								Why had none of this been picked up? &#160;A signal sighting committee is mandatory
								after a SPAD. &#160;That committee goes out and looks at the signal to determine if
								sighting is an issue. &#160;They were not convened in response to the SN109 incidents,
								despite the obvious high risks. &#160;Those committees would have demonstrated that the
								signal was not fit for purpose. No one could agree who was responsible for making these
								committees happen. &#160;The regional signal sighting chair told the inquiry he took no
								action as he didn&#8217;t believe anything would be done. Everybody seemed to know
								things weren&#8217;t right but they all thought it was someone else&#8217;s job to sort
								it out.<br />
								<br />
								This is a recurring theme when reading the Cullen report &#8211; apathy, incompetence,
								and a general lack of will to make changes. Signal sighting was not considered when the
								track layout was designed, but once the obvious problems had become clear no one seemed
								willing to do anything much about it. The end result was a signal that was obviously not
								right and everyone just waited until there was a major accident to sort it out.<br />
								<br />
								<br />
								Images not working. I'll try again later.

								Yes, yes they could have. This was mooted repeatedly but the answer was always a

								<br />
								The culture was that spads were a driver problem. Stuff was said like "It's worse

								This helps explain both the lack of motivation to take the sighting issue seriously, and

								Sorry for the delay for those interested. &#160;I was writing about how driver Michael
								Hodder managed to pass the supremely dodgy SN109 signal at danger, taking his train into
								the path of an oncoming HST travelling nearly 100mph at Ladbroke Grove. I wrote about
								how SN109 was a real hotspot signal, and I think people get why it had been passed so
								many times after seeing the photos. &#160;The other issue is Hodder himself.<br />
								<br />
								Michael Hodder had not been a driver with Thames Trains for long. He had started with
								the company in February 1999. These days it takes about a year to go from being new to
								driving by yourself. &#160;For him to have finished training in time to have this
								accident in October is very quick indeed. He qualified in September of that year, and
								drove a total of 20 times out of Paddington prior to this accident. &#160;On 19 of those
								times he hadn&#8217;t gone out on line 3, the line with SN109 on it. On the only
								occasion he had gone on line 3 SN109 had been green. He had never had to brake it at
								prior to the incident. When he, you know&#8230; didn&#8217;t.<br />
								<br />
								A key component of driver training is route learning. &#160;After you&#8217;ve done
								classroom based rules learning, practical fault finding/fixing training, and manual
								handling with a DI you have to do several months learning all the lines you will drive
								over. &#160;You don&#8217;t need to know signal numbers necessarily, but you need to
								know locations and potential routings you could be given by the signaller. This is
								really important in complex areas like Paddington.<br />
								<br />
								In addition to the main signal aspect telling the driver whether they can proceed or not
								lots of signals will have indicators to tell the driver how the route is set ahead of
								them. &#160;These can either be a box with a letter or number illuminated, or it can be
								&#8220;junction indicator&#8221; &#8211; a series of white lights in a line off to one
								side of the signal. In theory a &#8220;main aspect&#8221; with no junction indicator
								means you&#8217;re continuing straight on. A junction indicator off to the top right of
								the signal means you&#8217;re taking the first route off to the right. &#160;The second
								off to the right means the second route, and so on. In practice there is little
								consistency here. Where two lines split which one counts as &#8220;straight on&#8221;?
								The control measure here is that drivers have to learn what signals and what routings
								lead to where. Here&#8217;s an example of a signal with some junction indicators.<br />
								<br />
								<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/aotGKtt" target="_blank"
									rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/gallery/aotGKtt</a><br />
								<br />
								This may not seem like a safety issue at first but the crucial bit that makes it one is
								that you have to identify where your next signal will be. &#160;&#8220;If I&#8217;m
								going onto the mainline the next signal is just past the curve to the right, before the
								station&#8221; or &#8220;If I&#8217;m going over to the relief line the next signal is
								the one on the end of platform 4 at East Croydon&#8221; or whatever. &#160;That is no
								mean feat in locations like Paddington. 6 lines. All bi-directional. The whole idea is
								that you can go from line to line in a number of locations so that they can keep the
								service moving and get as many trains in and out of Paddington as possible.<br />
								<br />
								Here, for example, is a section of line on approach to another London terminal. &#160;11
								lines. Mostly bi-directional. <br />
								<br />
								<a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/izE9bM7" target="_blank"
									rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/gallery/izE9bM7</a><br />
								<br />
								If you pass signal TL2028 on the far right of the screen on 8 road and the junction
								indicator is lit where is your next signal? (Answer TL4118 on 9 road). &#160;If you are
								going to be driving on that route you have to demonstrate you know that.<br />
								<br />
								It might seem a simple case of mantra-like rote learning stuff. &#160;That is neither
								helpful nor feasible. You need to understand where everything is and where you are in
								relation to landmarks or you won&#8217;t be able to brake. &#160;That&#8217;s different
								from being able to recite the numbers. Also a study here recently showed train drivers
								have a reading age of about 13 on average. I&#8217;m not meaning that to denigrate them.
								&#160;I&#8217;ve yet to meet a train driver I would consider stupid as such &#8211;
								it&#8217;s a fearsomely competitive recruitment process after all. But they aren&#8217;t
								generally people who&#8217;ve had a particularly good relationship with traditional
								classroom education.<br />
								<br />
								Thames Trains training course was in a &#8220;transitionary stage&#8221; when Hodder was
								recruited. &#160;There were some notes for trainers but they didn&#8217;t appear to be
								using them as they didn&#8217;t like them much. &#160;They didn&#8217;t think the time
								for practical driving training to be sufficient so they had extended that bit. In
								practice this meant the time for route learning was cut short. &#160;In the end manager
								after manager for Thames Trains testified that they did not think it was their
								responsibility to teach Hodder the route and assess him on it. It turned out no one had
								really done it. &#160;No route maps were provided to trainees. There were assessments,
								but it was unclear what the criteria for passing or failing were.<br />
								<br />
								Route learning should also include information on known risks. &#160;SN109 with its
								illustrious SPAD history would certainly have qualified. &#160;But Thames Trains
								didn&#8217;t appear to have issued any kind of warnings to drivers about SN109, or any
								other MultiSPAD signal. Driver Adams, Hodder&#8217;s Driving Instructor for almost all
								of the practical part of his training, was not aware SN109 had been passed at danger
								multiple times. &#160;Paddington was a high risk for SPADs and a large majority were by
								Thames Trains services. Surprise surprise.<br />
								<br />
								Hodder approached SN109 on line 3 after receiving a junction indicator on his previous
								signal while driving on line 4 &#8211; SN87. &#160;Did he know after passing SN87 with a
								junction indicator that his next signal was SN109? If he didn&#8217;t know to look for
								it at the right moment would he have seen it at all, given the sighting was so poor?
								&#160;Did he know that there was a signal on that gantry that applied to the line he was
								on? Or did he misread the signal because of the unorthodox shape and think he had a
								proceed aspect of some kind? We don&#8217;t know for certain obviously, but the
								investigation concluded that a significant contributory factor was likely to be the fact
								that it could not be demonstrated that Hodder really knew the line. &#160;Thames could
								demonstrate he knew the rules. They could demonstrate he knew the train. But they
								couldn&#8217;t demonstrate he knew Paddington.<br />
								<br />
								The biggest outcome of the Ladbroke Grove crash in the area I work in has been the
								formalisation of route learning processes. &#160;Companies come up with norms for the
								amount of time and amount of trips over it necessary to learn a route. They do risk
								assessments on the routes and identify the concrete things a candidate must be able to
								demonstrate to be considered competent. &#160;This would include speeds, routings, and
								high risk signals.<br />
								<br />
								The crash also highlighted the risks posed by new drivers, who we now refer to as
								&#8220;PQ&#8221; &#8211; post qualified. &#160;It takes time to get yourself into the
								rhythm of train driving. Whilst the old guard have a hell of a lot of bad habits they
								also generally know when and how to get themselves into a focussed mindset when things
								get tricky. &#160;That takes time to learn. And even with route learning a new driver is
								just not going to have all the innate reflexive responses to the signals they see that a
								more experienced driver would. The experienced lot know the line inside out. <br />
								<br />
								Anyway, that covers why SN109 was passed, and why it was Hodder that passed it. &#160;If
								anyone is still awake I can write a bit about why after passing the signal the route was
								set into the path of another train.

								Yep. Also a factor. Something like 8am in October. Low sun is always an issue. He may

								Flank protection means that if a train passes a signal at danger it should be routed to
								wherever presents the lowest risk. This involves an assessment of what kind of movements
								are going on in the area, what the line speed is, and what the distance is between the
								signal and the &#8220;conflict point&#8221; &#8211; where one train is brought into a
								conflict with another.<br />
								<br />
								In the case of Paddington line 3 the points could either be set in such a way as to take
								a train onto the Up Main, as happened to Hodder, or onto the Down Relief. It seems in
								hindsight a terrible mistake to have them set by default, when SN109 was at danger, so
								as a train movement would go onto the Up Main. &#160;The Up Main had frequent,
								incredibly high speed, movements primarily in the opposite direction. But would the Down
								Relief have been any better? The line speed was the same (I think), and there were fewer
								movements. However crucially the distance from the signal to the conflict point was much
								shorter.<br />
								<br />
								It was mandated in a railway industry standard in 1988 that flank protection should be
								provided, i.e. points should be set to divert unauthorised moves like Hodder&#8217;s
								away from legitimate moves like Cooper&#8217;s. &#160;As we see above that is not as
								simple as it first seems when you&#8217;ve got complex layouts. Both directions could
								include conflict with legitimate moves. <br />
								<br />
								Paddington was resignalled after this standard came into force and, in a familiar story,
								no one was entirely clear on whose responsibility it had been to weigh up the risks of
								flank protection in regards to SN109 and document a decision on which way the points
								should face. &#160;In retrospect it was decided the longer overrun distance to the Up
								Main was the deciding factor, but clearly another factor was that the layout had to be
								flexible. If points had to be set in certain ways every time each signal was at danger
								then the movements around those signals would be highly restricted. &#160;This
								undermined the whole point of the resignalling. The 1988 standard only said flank
								protection should be used where it would be &#8220;simple and effective&#8221;. In the
								case of Paddington it could be legitimately said it would be neither of those.<br />
								<br />
								We have a more formalised risk assessment process in place now, and a lot more careful
								consideration would be given in a documented fashion when putting in a layout like this.
								&#160;The key difference, and one of the big outcomes from Ladbroke Grove, is that we
								now have Train Protection Warning System (TPWS).<br />
								<br />
								TPWS is basically a system that protects conflict points, or minimises the impact of
								them. &#160;When you do a risk assessment on a signal if it were to be found that there
								are significant conflicting moves involved one of the mitigations that could be put in
								would be TPWS. &#160;As such it is fitted to nearly all signals at junctions.
								Here&#8217;s an example signal from my home station I photographed on my way to
								work:<br />
								<br />
								<a href="https://imgur.com/a/0TG3ZNo" target="_blank"
									rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/0TG3ZNo</a><br />
								<br />
								That signal protects a junction but actually as you can see with the empty coaching
								stock train going over the points ahead any movement past that signal at danger would
								conflict with movements from the left. &#160;A SPAD at that signal, at line speed, would
								have a significant chance of resulting in a side on collision because movements over
								that junction are frequent and the overrun distance is not all that long. So there is a
								TPWS grid fitted. &#160;It&#8217;s the thing in the middle of the track directly next to
								the signal that looks like a barbecue grid. When the signal is red the grid is energised
								and it sends a message to any train that passes over it to apply the emergency brakes.
								That won&#8217;t stop a SPAD, as the train will already have gone past the signal at
								that point, but it will help protect the conflict point &#8211; in this case the bit
								where the line coming from the left meets yours. That&#8217;s called a train stop sensor
								(TSS).<br />
								<br />
								At locations at high speeds applying emergency brakes at the signal won&#8217;t stop a
								train passing a conflict. &#160;So you may also have Overspeed grids on approach to the
								signal. Those look the same but are set in pairs. The train passes over the first one
								(the arming grid) and if it then reaches the second grid too quickly (the trigger grid)
								that sends an emergency stop signal. &#160;Both grids are collectively called an
								overspeed sensor (OSS). Varying the distance the grids are set apart gives you the
								ability to set a speed at which the OSS will apply the brakes, forcing drivers to brake
								on approach to the signal.<br />
								<br />
								This has not eliminated the possibility of a train passing a conflict point as it is
								hard to set grids appropriately for all types of traction that might pass over a route.
								&#160;Freight trains in particular can take miles to stop at line speed so the OSS grids
								would have to be set miles away from signals, which isn&#8217;t feasible. The other
								problem with the system is that the driver can just turn it off. There is an isolation
								switch on the back wall of the cab. &#160;It would be a complete violation of every rule
								in the book for a driver to use that without authorisation, but there is nothing
								physically preventing it. If a driver flicked that switch, put the train into full power
								on approach to the buffer stops, and just sat back and waited like that Germanwings
								pilot then the first thing to stop the train would be whatever concession stand is on
								the nearby concourse.<br />
								<br />
								The result of this system is that the Ladbroke Grove crashes of the past are probably
								now TPWS brake demand incidents, not SPAD incidents. &#160;It certainly seems to me that
								a larger number of SPADs now happen at low speeds (i.e. where the OSS grid
								wouldn&#8217;t have caught it first) or are on signals without TPWS fitment at all.
								&#160;Consequently they are lower risk on paper &#8211; if it was a high risk location
								TPWS would be fitted.<br />
								<br />
								Incidentally, TPWS would also likely have prevented the Cowden crash. &#160;If you
								passed OD58 at danger now I&#8217;m pretty confident the grids would stop the train
								before entering the single line section

								Still here. Thought I&#8217;d write something about Southall. &#160;This actually
								happened in the run up to Ladbroke Grove and in a similar area &#8211; the Paddington
								corridor. I think it helps to show why SPADs were so firmly implanted in peoples minds.
								<br />
								<br />
								The other reason it&#8217;s interesting is that there is a brief video of it happening,
								taken from a security camera nearby. &#160;Very brief. Not grisly or anything, but 7
								people died so if you don&#8217;t want to watch it in the knowledge that&#8217;s whats
								happening inside the coaches bear that in mind before clicking.<br />

								19th September 1997. Driver Tunnock took an HST, like the one Hodder collided with at
								Ladbroke Grove, out of Old Oak Common depot. &#160;He drove it to nearby Paddington in
								time for it to form the 07:00 train to Swansea in south Wales. He changed ends at
								Swansea and the train became 1A47, the 10:32 Swansea to Paddington. At Cardiff he was
								relieved by Driver Larry Harrison.<br />
								<br />
								Harrison drove as normal from Cardiff as far as the Paddington corridor on approach to
								London, although staff at a few stations he stopped at later remarked that he seemed
								very casual indeed. &#160;At two locations they reported he had his feet up on the desk
								in front of him while driving into the station. Then near Southall, while driving at
								125mph, Harrison passed SN280 at double yellow and made no reaction. &#160;Then he
								passed the next signal SN270 at single yellow, meaning the next was red, and still made
								no reaction. Finally SN254 came into view at red. However it was much too late. Despite
								putting the brakes in Harrison SPADed SN254, and was still doing over 60mph 410 meters
								passed the signal when he had a side on collision with a freight train.<br />
								<br />
								The power car Harrison was driving was actually relatively minimally damaged, and he had
								left his seat to go hide in the engine compartment. &#160;As a result he survived with
								minor injuries. The following coaches were the worst hit, and one was turned into a U
								shape as it got caught between the stuff coming from behind at 60mph and a piece of
								overhead wiring stanchion. 7 people died, 6 on the scene and one in hospital later.
								&#160;Hundreds others were injured. The driver of the freight train, Alan Bricker, was
								unhurt. He had attempted, when he saw the HST approaching at over 100mph, to accelerate
								his train off the junction but it was a gigantic slow moving conga line of freight
								carriages and it was never going to move quick enough.<br />
								<br />
								The freight train was crossing over all lines, from Acton Yard north of the lines to
								Southall Yard south of the lines. Signaller Forde in the ill-fated Slough signalling
								centre had set all other signals to red to allow this. However TPWS wasn&#8217;t a thing
								yet, so there was no protection for that freight train beyond the signals themselves.
								&#160;If a driver ignored them for whatever reason there would inevitably be a
								collision.<br />
								<br />
								A lot was made of the decision by Forde to allow the freight train over the lines and
								slow or stop Harrison&#8217;s high speed passenger service for it. This was shortly
								after privatisation. &#160;In the days of nationalised British Rail freight trains had
								absolute lowest priority for signallers setting routes, and could routinely wait hours
								before being allowed out of yards and onto the main line. &#160;But then the railway was
								privatised and the track ownership and management was taken over by Railtrack.<br />
								<br />
								The way train regulation (i.e. what trains get what routes and in what kind of
								preferencing system) are currently managed is effectively through a system of
								contractual negotiations between train companies and the track owner. &#160;In this case
								between Great Western Trains, which ran the HST, and Railtrack, which has since been
								replaced with Network Rail. Where Railtrack/NR agreed to provide a pathway for a train
								and then don&#8217;t do so they pay fines for the delay minutes to the train company.
								&#160;Where a train company has a pathway and obstructs it by something that causes a
								delay their end they pay fines to Railtrack/NR.<br />
								<br />
								This is roughly similar to how the railway ran before nationalisation in the 1940s.
								&#160;Hundreds of people are employed to argue over what minutes of delay were caused by
								what so the bill between the companies can keep on circulating. &#160;Getting rid of all
								this was a substantial efficiency saving in the 1940s. In the 1990s in the name of
								privatised efficiency we brought it all back. &#160;Can we get rid of it again please?
								It&#8217;s fucking stupid.<br />
								<br />
								Anyway, the consequence was that the signallers were all sent on courses so they could
								be told how decisions they made about what trains to hold and what to give routes for
								could have significant commercial consequences for Railtrack. &#160;Railtrack issued a
								regulation policy for signallers that said they should make their decisions on the basis
								of what would cause least total delay. Experts for the inquiry into the Southall crash
								analysed the train movements Signaller Forde was faced with and decided that with it was
								pretty much the best decision he could have made from the point of view of least delay.
								&#160;He wasn&#8217;t considered at fault. The inquiry concluded that regulation
								decisions should be made with the assumption that drivers would obey signals. I
								personally don&#8217;t agree, but I don&#8217;t fault the signaller for following his
								instructions.<br />
								<br />
								The after effects of privatisation were evident all through this inquiry as they also
								featured in the other prominent question here &#8211; the fact that the Advanced Warning
								System (AWS) was isolated on the train. &#160;AWS was introduced from the 1950s as an
								audible and visual reminder of the signal aspect. About 180 meters from the signal the
								train passes over a magnet. If the associated signal is green it sounds a bell in the
								cab and the driver has no action to take. &#160;If it is any kind of restrictive aspect
								(red, yellow, or double yellow) a horn sounds and the driver has 3-4 seconds to depress
								a plunger to cancel it. If they don&#8217;t do so the brakes come on. Also when the horn
								sounds a circular display in the cab turns black and yellow, so even after the horn has
								been cancelled the driver can always look down and see whether their last signal was
								restrictive or not.<br />
								<br />
								This has its limitations. &#160;The AWS was functioning in the Cowden crash &#8211;
								Brian Barton (or whoever was driving) would have received a horn and cancelled it on
								approach to OD58, but then didn&#8217;t react to the signal. &#160;The AWS was
								functioning at Ladbroke Grove &#8211; Hodder had a horn at the double yellow and
								cancelled, he had a horn at a single yellow and cancelled it, and a horn at the red on
								SN109 and cancelled it. &#160;He still went passed the signal. It sounds at every signal
								so it can become second nature to cancel without really thinking what you are doing.
								Nevertheless it is an important aid to the driver and is considered a key safety
								system.<br />
								<br />
								When Driver Tunnock took the HST out of the depot in the early hours of the morning he
								was driving it from the westwards direction cab (the &#8220;London End&#8221;). &#160;He
								realised the AWS wasn&#8217;t working. When the horn sounded he couldn&#8217;t cancel it
								so the brakes came on. Until he isolated the AWS system entirely in the London End cab
								he couldn&#8217;t move the train. &#160;He got to Paddington and reported it to the on
								call rostering manager. They phoned control, whose responsibility it was to inform
								Railtrack so the signallers would know. No one did so. At the inquiry they denied ever
								having received the call from Paddington, although it was noticeable that stories about
								who had taken what calls changed in the course of the inquiry. &#160;The upshot was
								Railtrack and the signallers were not informed the train had no AWS when being driving
								in the London End. If Forde had known the train had no AWS would he have attempted to
								slow it to allow the freight to go, or would have waited 5 minutes until the HST was out
								of the way? <br />
								<br />
								No one told Tunnock to take the train out of service. &#160;The rules at the time said a
								train could not enter service with the AWS isolated. &#160;But at the inquiry no one
								could agree what &#8220;enter service&#8221; meant. Great Western Trains took it to mean
								it couldn&#8217;t come out of a depot in that condition, so saw no reason to cancel it
								once it was at Paddington. &#160;The Rail Regulator, who had written the rule book,
								clarified that they had meant &#8220;service&#8221; in the sense of each separate train
								journey. So a journey should never be started with the AWS not working. <br />
								<br />
								This has now been completely clarified. &#160;If the AWS breaks mid journey the train
								can continue, but only at reduced speed. &#160;A new journey can&#8217;t start with
								broken AWS, except for a journey to take the train to a depot to have it fixed. At the
								time other questions were asked, with no definitive answers arising, about whether
								fragmentation of the industry had allowed the multiple interpretations of the rules to
								flourish, and the communication barriers between companies to rise.<br />
								<br />
								At the heart of the whole incident though was Driver Larry Harrison, who drove a train
								with his feet up with a safety system isolated and made no attempt to respond to two
								cautionary signals. &#160;He couldn&#8217;t account for why he hadn&#8217;t seen them.
								He said he had been putting things in his bag and looked up and saw the red. For a
								start, you shouldn&#8217;t be messing around with your kit bag when driving.
								&#160;Secondly, we&#8217;re talking about nearly a minute of time between SN280 coming
								in to view at double yellow and SN270 going out of view at single yellow. Did he really
								not look up, when going at 125mph, for that entire time?<br />
								<br />
								The accusation was raised that the bag had other significance though. &#160;In theory it
								shouldn&#8217;t be possible to drive with your feet up on main line trains as the
								Drivers Safety Device/Drivers Vigilance Device is operated with your feet. &#160;This is
								a pedal you have to stand on continuously. If you stop doing so for more than a few
								seconds the brakes come on. It&#8217;s the safety measure for the driver becoming
								incapacitated in some way. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								The suspicion was that perhaps Harrison had his bag on the pedal so he could recline, or
								possibly even get up and walk about the cab. After the crash a policeman was on site
								nearly immediately, having witnessed the whole thing happen while driving past.
								&#160;They reported that Harrison seemed extremely agitated to go into the wreckage to
								get his bag back, and knew exactly where to look for it. Harrison was allowed to
								retrieve the bag and no evidence was recorded about where it had been. Manslaughter
								charges were brought against him, but the case collapsed without a conviction.<br />
								<br />
								Immediately following the crash Harrison phoned the signal box from a lineside phone.
								&#160;The policeman took over halfway through the call. That was transcribed for the
								inquiry:<br />

								Another two part piece for you all. &#160;First bit about Eltham Well Hall, going back
								to 1972. &#160;It&#8217;s a properly different world we&#8217;re looking at here, which
								tells a bit of a story when you compare it to a more recent event.<br />
								<br />
								On 11th June 1972 Robert Wilsdon was booked to drive the return leg of an
								&#8220;excursion&#8221; trip from London to Margate, on the Kent coast. &#160;It was a
								day trip for tourists, specially scheduled. Now they&#8217;d be called
								&#8220;charter&#8221; trains. He was supposed to book on about 3pm in London but instead
								phoned up his rostering manager that afternoon and told them he&#8217;d go directly to
								Ramsgate for about 5pm to take the train out of the depot. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								He arrived in Ramsgate, took the train to Margate, had a short break, then drove it back
								to London full of tourists on their way back from the beach. At Eltham Well Hall the
								track dips sharply and curves. &#160;There is a 20mph speed restriction. Wilsdon shut
								off power at about 60mph at the top of the hill but didn&#8217;t apply the brake at all.
								He hit the curve at about 65mph and derailed the front few coaches, killing himself and
								four passengers.<br />
								<br />
								A few days later Wilsdon was tested and found to have been blind drunk. There were
								discrepancies between the alcohol levels in his blood and those in his urine, indicating
								that in fact his body was still absorbing alcohol so he had probably been drinking in
								the immediate run up to the accident. The levels were consistent with him having drunk
								about 8-9 pints of beer. He had seen an awful lot of other staff during the day and no
								one had raised any alarm.<br />
								<br />
								Wilsdon had been accompanied all shift by his &#8220;Secondman&#8221;, a grade that no
								longer exists. This was the eighteen year old P.E. Stokes, who survived and was
								interviewed in hospital. He said when Wilsdon had met him at Ramsgate he had smelt of
								alcohol, but they had worked together for 2 years and Stokes had often seen him in
								nearby pubs around the depot socially. &#160;He believed &#8220;Bob&#8221; could
								&#8220;hold a great deal&#8221;, and didn&#8217;t think to inform anyone. He said
								Wilsdon had told him he&#8217;d drunk 2-3 pints with his brothers at lunch, then drunk a
								bottle of sherry with them in the afternoon. When they&#8217;d got to Margate Wilsdon
								had told him they had some time so they both went to the pub. They had about 2-3 pints
								each there before getting back to the train. They got back in the cab and, reading
								between the lines in his report, Stokes then fell asleep. &#160;He remembered pretty
								much nothing else other than Wilsdon&#8217;s last words as the train tipped:
								&#8220;fucking hell&#8221;.<br />
								<br />
								Wilsdon&#8217;s brothers admitted they&#8217;d been drinking with him at lunch but both
								denied they&#8217;d drunk sherry with him in the afternoon. &#160;They said he never
								drank sherry. Given that the blood alcohol results were already in by this point it
								isn&#8217;t clear what purpose this obvious lie serves. &#160;Wilsdon was very drunk. If
								it didn&#8217;t happen with them then it happened while he was on duty, which was even
								worse. The inquiry came to the conclusion either his brothers were lying or he had a
								bottle of spirits with him in the cab of some description. Two bottles of beer were
								found unopened in the cab, as a gift from the excursion organisers to Wilsdon and
								Stokes. &#160;This was common for trains of this nature.<br />
								<br />
								After the accident British Rail changed its policy on drinking. &#160;Previously it had
								been against the rules to drink on duty. Now it became against the rules to book on
								under the influence. &#160;The inquiry considered this sufficient. The limit of its
								recommendations on the subject were to suggest tighter controls on train crew booking on
								for duty away from their depot, as when they did that it meant no one could verify if
								they were fit for duty or not.<br />
								<br />
								I find the whole thing horrifying, from a modern point of view. &#160;Obviously the
								incident is terrible, and I have little sympathy Wilsdon, but the inquiry does not read
								well. Back then it seems like it was an industry of alcoholics and those making excuses
								for alcoholics and desperately trying to avoid having to do anything about the
								problem.<br />
								<br />
								Wilsdon definitely booked on drunk, and he definitely saw other members of staff when he
								did so. None of them raised the alarm, as it was in fact not uncommon. &#160;What
								difference would it have made if he had booked on at his home depot as the report
								recommended? I doubt anyone would have given a shit there either. The report noted it
								was already against the rules for crew to drink on duty, but then failed to draw any
								conclusions from the fact that Stokes and Wilsdon were doing so without anyone being the
								slightest concerned about it while it was happening. &#160;Shouldn&#8217;t that make you
								question the culture you were dealing with?<br />
								<br />
								The report briefly considered recommending rules similar to those governing airline
								pilots, where at the time they were not allowed to drink for 8 hours before a shift.
								&#160;This was rejected out of hand as it would be: &#8220;unfair to the ordinary
								responsible, sober, and decent driver who likes a drink with his dinner.&#8221;<br />
								<br />
								There aren&#8217;t that many people still around on the railway who were around then.
								&#160;When you speak to the ones who were this story doesn&#8217;t seem all that out of
								the ordinary. &#160;Back then when the rostering manager needed to find the booked cover
								crew they would phone the local pub. &#160;Even if it was against the rules it was
								clearly not enforced. Much like the culture of fatigue there was a culture of hard
								drinking that wouldn&#8217;t change for several years yet.

								The second half to the thing I was writing about regarding drunk train drivers is the
								Cannon Street crash of 1991, nearly 20 years after Wilsdon storming along at Eltham Well
								Hall.<br />
								<br />
								Morris Graham (never trust someone with two first names) was driving a packed morning
								commuter train on 8th January 1991 from Sevenoaks in Kent suburbia to London Cannon
								Street. &#160;Cannon Street is one of the smaller London terminals all things
								considered, but it is still incredibly busy in the mornings as it&#8217;s very close to
								the financial district. The 8 coach train had over 1000 people on it. Graham hit the
								start of the platform at about 15mph as far as we can tell, but didn&#8217;t brake after
								that until far too late. &#160;He hit the buffer stops at about 10mph.<br />
								<br />
								Poor crashworthiness was again a factor here, like at Clapham Junction. &#160;Old
								rolling stock, which was fortunately being phased out, simply didn&#8217;t hold up to
								the stresses of the collision. &#160;More importantly numerous couplers between coaches
								failed and allowed several coaches to ride up over the ones in front. &#160;Hundreds
								were injured and two people were killed, despite a collision speed of only 10mph.
								Graham, and the trainee driver who happened to be in the cab, were both unhurt.
								&#160;The injuries were all due to crumpling compartments and the cramped rush hour
								conditions.<br />
								<br />
								Three days later Graham had a medical examination and tested positive for cannabis.
								&#160;It was not possible to tell exactly what effect this would have had. It
								wasn&#8217;t like with Wilsdon &#8211; where he was so drunk it&#8217;s hard to see how
								he even got in the cab. The results were clear that Graham had taken cannabis recently,
								but it wasn&#8217;t well understood exactly what effects the amount he had would have
								been on him at the time. &#160;The test was not done immediately, and even if it had
								been it&#8217;s hard to draw a direct line of cause and effect unless the results you
								get are really high.<br />
								<br />
								Nevertheless it was concluded that the results would have been consistent with longer
								reaction times, which might explain why Graham had apparently shouted to the trainee
								driver that the brakes weren&#8217;t working as they approached the buffers. &#160;The
								brakes were tested and found to be working fine. There was no on train data recorder but
								testimony from passengers and staff was that Graham hadn&#8217;t braked when they would
								normally expect. If he had applied the brakes late and found the train didn&#8217;t slow
								enough he may have interpreted this quite genuinely as the brakes failing.
								&#160;Applying train brakes is basically a matter of judgement of timing. The inquiry
								concluded his sense of timing may have been impaired, although it wasn&#8217;t
								ultimately possible to say for certain.<br />
								<br />
								Again Graham had not booked on at their home depot but gone straight to pick his train
								up, with agreement from his rostering manager. &#160;As with Eltham Well Hall the
								inquiry concluded this practice should be reviewed. Nothing had been done about it in 20
								years, but seeing as it&#8217;s efficacy at stopping people booking on when under the
								influence was obviously limited I can see why no one was especially animated to enforce
								that rule. &#160;The big conclusion was that it should be made a criminal offence to
								drive a train while under the influence of drink or drugs.<br />
								<br />
								The outcome was the Transport and Public Works Act of 1994. &#160;This made it illegal
								to book on with drink or drugs in your system. Crucially it also made it so that if an
								employee commits this offence the employer is also considered to have committed it
								unless they can demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to stop it happening.
								There&#8217;s a lot of wriggle room there, but the key point is this at least gives an
								incentive for managers to enforce the policy, which was previously not happening.<br />
								<br />
								In order to protect themselves train operating companies now all have &#8220;zero
								tolerance&#8221; drug and alcohol policies. The unions are in almost complete agreement
								with this, and will only put up a token resistance for you if you are caught.
								&#160;Employees are subject to random testing, &#8220;for cause&#8221; testing following
								incidents, and periodic testing at key medicals or when getting promotions. If you are
								found with anything in your system you are almost guaranteed to be out of a job.
								&#160;Whether the company then refers it on to the police depends on how they feel about
								it. But they have the power to do so if they wish.<br />
								<br />
								The limitations this puts on you as an average member of staff are actually quite
								significant. &#160;There is no set time in which you can&#8217;t drink before a shift,
								you just have to be confident it wouldn&#8217;t show up in a test. &#160;With regards to
								drugs the actual effects on you may last for only a few days but they could still cause
								a positive test result months later. Personally I find it amazing that still a not
								insignificant number of people take the chance and get caught out. &#160;Random testing
								regimes are, in my experience, pretty sparse, so it is amazing anyone is caught at all
								by them. The more likely possibility for most people is that you would have an unrelated
								incident, like having a low risk SPAD or tripping the TPWS grids, and the automatic
								&#8220;for cause&#8221; test would highlight something &#8211; possibly from months ago.
								&#160;At that point you are gone. <br />
								<br />
								Most drugs and alcohol policies also state you have to inform the company if you are on
								any medication. &#160;Not only so they can tell you if it makes you unfit to work, but
								so you are covered if it shows up in a random test. &#160;If this weren&#8217;t the case
								most positive test results would trigger disputes about whether the results were due to
								illegal substances or herbal supplements/athletes foot cream/aspirin. &#160;As it stands
								you can claim that the reason your urine is 90% cocaine is because of the side effects
								of your heart tablets but the employer is under no obligation to even investigate that
								&#8211; they can just respond by asking why you didn&#8217;t declare that in good
								time.<br />
								<br />
								There are still a lot of drinkers on the railway, but they pretty much keep it to rest
								days now. The Transport and Public Works Act did its job or braking the back of the
								culture of no one really caring about drinking.<br />
								<br />
								Its still in theory industry best practice to require crew to book on at their home
								depot. &#160;If anything, however, this has slipped back even further over time.
								&#160;The purpose of it was always to ensure someone could have some kind of oversight
								of your fitness to work. &#160;However a lot of depots now no longer have managers on
								call so even if you book on their no one has oversight of it. &#160;I worked for years
								at a huge depot where managers were on call at all times but you actually booked on
								remotely anyway &#8211; via an automated system in the roster room. &#160;So even though
								the managers were there you never actually saw them; there were simply too many crew for
								that to be feasible. Lots of freight companies have remote booking on via telephone as
								standard. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								The unofficial booking on away from your home depot still goes on all the time.
								&#160;Given that the purpose of going to your depot has been diluted the importance of
								it seems pretty minimal to train crew, and I can hardly blame them.

								<br />
								Thanks! And jesus that's some rainfall. As yet there aren't any systems I'm aware of to
								detect weather related obstacles so if the track circuits are still functioning no one
								would know what was going on. Although if the ground has physically gone I would assume
								the track circuit has long since tripped. <br />
								<br />
								I'm not 100% sure the system in 1972 but now the dead man handle or "drivers safety
								device" is integrated into the "drivers vigilance device" which can be unnecessarily
								confusing. <br />
								<br />
								The drivers safety device is a pedal that has to be continuously depressed or the train
								will stop. The drivers vigilance device is a piggy backing system to basically give the
								driver a stimulus that requires response every 50-60 seconds. An alarm rings and you
								have to take your lift your foot off the DSD pedal briefly then put it back. If you
								don't, you guessed it, the breaks come on. <br />
								<br />
								Both the DSD and the DVD are separate entirely from any trackside signalling. They both
								function as long as the train is in the equivalent of forward gear. If you were
								completely stationary for a few minutes but had it in forward you would get DVD alarms
								still. The AWS horn/bell is different and sounds in relation to whatever signal you are
								approaching. <br />
								<br />
								The hardest thing to get your head around as a trainee in the first few days is what
								each sound means and what you have to do in response. When you're concentrating like
								fuck on just braking, because it's a 12 car train and that's terrifying, the last thing
								you need is random shit ringing at you and requiring responses in 4-5 seconds. <br />
								<br />
								Don't know when dvd was introduced though. It was definitely around for Southall in 1999
								but I'm not sure about Eltham.

								There was a specific request for this one earlier. Hatfield &#8211; the accident that
								broke the entire railway network. Warning &#8211; long.<br />
								<br />
								This was an engineering accident rather than an immediate human failing in railway
								operating, like most of the stuff I know more about. &#160;What is very interesting
								though is the decaying management structure that had allowed the situation as a whole to
								come about. It lead to a complete reorganisation of the rail industry and was a big
								political scandal. &#160;Combined with Ladbroke Grove and the earlier Potters Bar
								derailment railway safety seemed at crisis point.<br />
								<br />
								17 October 2000. &#160;The 12:10 from London Kings Cross to Leeds was travelling at
								115mph down the East Coast Main Line on what was known as the Down Fast line. &#160;At
								Welham Green curve, just south of Hatfield the left hand rail cracked under the driving
								locomotive, sending fragments of rail into the wheels and undercarriage. &#160;As the
								train passed over the cracks at speed the rail completely came apart, causing the
								subsequent coaches to derail. The buffet car turned over and was thrown into one of the
								masts that supported the overhead wires. &#160;Four people in that carriage were killed
								and several, including the two buffet car staff, were seriously injured.<br />
								<br />
								Derailments occur for lots of reasons &#8211; train speed, improperly set points, track
								&#8220;spread&#8221;, track geometry, and the physical conditions of the rails
								themselves. &#160;In this case everything was fine except the actual rails. They had
								come apart due to what is known as &#8220;gauge corner cracking&#8221;. The gauge corner
								is the corner of the rail head where the main flat of the wheel and the flange both
								contact the rail &#8211; the top edge on the inside of the tracks. &#160;It is the bit
								that receives most contact from the wheels so it is vulnerable to rolling contact
								fatigue. <br />
								<br />
								Here&#8217;s a diagram of what different bits of rail are apparently called:<br />
								<br />
								<a href="https://imgur.com/a/xnneKJv" target="_blank"
									rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/xnneKJv</a><br />
								<br />
								And here&#8217;s a cross section of what gauge corner cracking looks like on the
								insde:<br />
								<br />

								<br />
								As to how that had come about we have to go to a policy making level. &#160;In 1994 the
								UK&#8217;s railways were privatised. To run the actual trains the Department for
								Transport would draw up a series of long term franchises for each set of routes and then
								bids would be submitted for them. &#160;Successful bids would then be given the
								franchise as a Train Operating Company (TOC) or Freight Operating Company (FOC), e.g.
								Thames Trains from the Ladbroke Grove crash, or Great Western Railway from the Southall
								crash. They pay a fee for the privilege of running that route, have to submit to various
								obligations about what services they will run, and their incentive is they get to keep
								the revenue remaining. It&#8217;s incredibly complicated and bureaucratically wasteful,
								but that&#8217;s the basics.<br />
								<br />
								Running trains is only one part of the work of keeping the railway going though, and
								John Major&#8217;s Conservative government was committed to putting the whole industry
								in the private sector. &#160;So they created Railtrack, a private company that had
								responsibility for the infrastructure. This company had to ensure the track was
								maintained and where appropriate improved and updated. It also employed the signallers.
								&#160;Railtrack in turn contracted out most of the maintenance work via a tendering
								process. So the actual work of ensuring the track on the East Coast Main Line was safe
								to run trains on was being done by Balfour Beatty.<br />
								<br />
								Industry standards, and the contract with Railtrack, required Balfour Beatty to patrol
								the track regularly. &#160;This was not done. Where it was done they walked from the
								side of the tracks, although the standard was that the patrol should be done from the
								area between the tracks, the &#8220;four foot&#8221;. Patrol report sheets indicated
								their patrols from one side of the tracks were supposed to cover all four lines &#8211;
								the Up and Down Fast, and the Up and Down Slow. Here is what they were supposed to be
								looking for, at a potential distance of 20-30 meters:<br />
								<br />

								<br />
								Ultrasound examination was also required, and carried out. However the staff
								weren&#8217;t really trained in what their responsibilities were when doing it.
								&#160;They found defects, wrote them in reports, then took no further action. No
								comprehensive record of defects found, level of seriousness, and action taken, was kept.
								Balfour Beatty managers knew of the defects, and in particular knew the Welham Green
								Curve was a top priority area, but didn&#8217;t have the resources to fulfil their
								contractual obligations. They wrote up a recovery plan to deal with the increasingly out
								of control situation, but it was not comprehensively risk assessed for priority. They
								twice delayed replacing the rails at Welham Green curve in the months before the
								derailment.<br />
								<br />
								Railtrack, meanwhile, had the ultimate responsibility to ensure this work was being
								done. &#160;Balfour Beatty was merely their instrument for doing it. They knew Balfour
								Beatty hadn&#8217;t done the work, and wrote to them continuously to ask what they were
								doing, but took no concrete action. &#160;They did not know Balfour Beatty hadn&#8217;t
								trained their staff appropriately as they had no oversight of the actual day to day
								functioning of the work. They undertook audits but the write ups of those indicated a
								marked lack of probity. &#160;Where recommendations were made no one chased them up.
								When the dust settled after the accident it was found that recommendations and plans for
								recovey had stacked up over time, but in almost no cases had any action been taken on
								any of them.<br />
								<br />
								The whole point of contracting out was so Railtrack would not have to be concerned by
								the technical work. This meant there was a complete de-skilling process whereby the
								managers responsible for ensuring Balfour Beatty were doing their job generally lacked
								the competence to know either way. In addition there was a significant lack of political
								will within Railtrack to challenge their contractors in a meaningful sense with
								enforcement action. Privatisation had to be a success. Contracts were set up in such a
								way as to encourage bid submissions so as to make the whole thing seem competitive. It
								had to be the flourishing of now unfettered private sector innovation. The best way to
								do that was draw up the contracts in such a way that they were very attractive to bid
								for.<br />
								<br />
								Railtrack also had the responsibility to impose speed restrictions where track defects
								were uncovered and not yet fixed. &#160;Obviously they hadn&#8217;t done that here. They
								had responsibility to keep records of the condition of the track across the country.
								&#160;As they had no control over their contractors actually doing the work their
								records were in an appalling state. Immediately after the crash the question was asked
								loudly, at a government level, where else this might be happening. &#160;Railtrack had
								no answer and so they took the incredible step of imposing 1800 speed restrictions of
								20mph around the country at places where they weren&#8217;t able to conclusively
								demonstrate the track had been maintained to the right levels.<br />
								<br />
								Part of this was a necessary safety response to the out of control situation. Part of it
								was political game playing as they felt they had been put in an impossible situation.
								&#160;From the second point of view it was a catastrophically bad idea. The chaos on the
								rail network was immense. It was estimated to be costing the UK economy as a whole
								&#163;6 million a day. Disruption continued for over a year. I&#8217;m not sure a better
								example of the incompetence of the infrastructure management was possible. &#160;They
								had been stewards of the infrastructure for just over six years and it took nearly a
								year to resolve the damage done in that time. In 2002 the Department for Transport
								forced Railtrack into administration and replaced them with Network Rail, which took the
								maintenance contracts back in house.<br />
								<br />
								Railtrack and Balfour Beatty were charged with corporate manslaughter, along with five
								individually named managers. These charges were later dropped. &#160;Both companies were
								found guilty of Health and Safety legislation breaches though. Railtrack was fined
								&#163;3.5 million and Balfour Beatty was fined &#163;10 million, which was then reduced
								on appeal to &#163;7.5 million. &#160;The previous highest railway related fine was the
								&#163;2 million Thames Trains had been fined after Ladbroke Grove. The high court judge
								awarding the fines described it as the worst case of corporate negligence they had ever
								seen.<br />
								<br />
								Ladbroke Grove probably had a bigger impact on day to day operations. &#160;It brought
								us TPWS, systematised route learning, and clear procedures for assessing route risks and
								mitigating them at a design and planning stage. Hatfield was the bigger organisational
								overhaul. &#160;The infrastructure manager was scrapped and replaced wholesale. The rail
								regulator was moved from the Health and Safety Executive to its own independent
								organisation &#8211; the Office of the Rail Regulator. The Railway Safety Standards
								Board was established. The Rail Accident Investigation Board was established. In terms
								of regulation and management those arrangements look roughly similar still today.

								A small postscript. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								One of the things that came out of the Hatfield debacle was the need to conduct track
								patrols and ultrasound testing regularly and document the results. &#160;Balfour Beatty
								had been doing that from the side of the tracks as they said it was the safest way to do
								it. Standards were strengthened to make it clear that this did not count as a sufficient
								examination. &#160;The infrastructure manager has the responsibility to ensure thorough
								examinations are conducted from positions on the actual line itself, and a safe system
								of work designed to allow that to happen. <br />
								<br />
								It is acceptable for that work to be carried out on lines open to traffic, whilst
								protected by a lookout, although all other methods have to be considered and ruled out
								as impractical. &#160;It was this chain of logic that led to John Wright acting as
								lookout for a colleague doing ultrasound testing outside Newark station in January 2014,
								as I wrote about previously, resulting in him being struck and killed.<br />
								<br />
								Two steps forward, one step back.

								I&#8217;ve not written anything for a while about trains. &#160;Thought I&#8217;d do
								something now as a really interesting report was published recently into a collision at
								Waterloo. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								People may remember I wrote about the Clapham Junction accident of 12 December 1988.
								&#160;We&#8217;ve just passed the 30 year anniversary of it. And lo and behold to mark
								the occasion we have a report into an incident with worrying similarities. &#160;In
								theory the Clapham Junction accident recommendations should have made this years&#8217;
								Waterloo incident impossible. The fact therefore that it happened at all raises some
								serious questions.<br />
								<br />
								At 05:42 on Tuesday 15th August this year a passenger train left Waterloo at 15mph.
								&#160;It was routed onto the Up Relief over points 1524 &#8211; specifically their
								&#8220;C&#8221; end. &#160;As the train approached the points the driver saw they
								weren&#8217;t actually set. He applied the emergency brakes but couldn&#8217;t stop the
								train before reaching them. &#160;The front carriage went the wrong way over the
								junction and collided with the freight train stabled on the adjacent line at 13mph. No
								one was hurt.<br />
								<br />
								Not exactly a big deal really, except for the fact that the signal box had all the
								lights and indications on their panels that 1524 points were set for the Up Relief line.
								&#160;Somewhere between the wiring in their panel, with the buttons they push to set the
								routes, and the physical motors that push the points one way or the other something was
								not right. &#160;That error had quite small consequences here but it is basically the
								same type of error as caused the Clapham Junction crash that killed 35 people. Hundreds
								of pages of procedures exist now to make that error impossible.<br />
								<br />
								Clapham Junction was caused by wiring errors in the Waterloo resignalling project of the
								mid to late 1980s. &#160;The latest Waterloo accident was caused by wiring errors in the
								current resignalling project for the same area. &#160;30 years on and everything needs
								replacing again. In particular platforms are being extended at Waterloo to allow longer
								trains to keep up with passenger numbers. &#160;This requires moving a lot of pointwork,
								which in turn requires moving the signals that protect those points and the wires and
								relays that control those signals. So there was a huge blockade of large sections of
								Waterloo station and the approach to it in August this year.<br />
								<br />
								In order to allow the necessary work to go on in the months up to and following that
								blockade a test deck was constructed that would simulate the inputs and outputs of the
								wiring as it was being installed. &#160;Spur wires were added in the relay room while
								testing was carried out so that indications were sent to the test deck. A
								&#8220;principles tester&#8221; sat with the deck in Wimbledon signal box. They would
								call up each one of the numerous routes possible in and out of Waterloo and check to see
								if the indications received were correct. &#160;The points on the ground would not
								physically move during this. The plan was then that the test deck would be removed when
								the track was returned to normal operation.<br />
								<br />
								When testing 1524 points the principles tester found they did not get detection on their
								panel. &#160;The circuits that showed whether the motors had done their job (or
								simulated it in this case) were not feeding correctly back to the panel. &#160;The
								principles tester called up their colleague in the relay room &#8211; the
								&#8220;functional tester&#8221;. The functional tester, in contravention of every
								principle in the rulebook, went and added some wires to fix the problem. &#160;They got
								detection. The testing was later completed and in the morning of 15th August the track
								was handed back.<br />
								<br />
								However the wires added by the functional tester were added to the bits and pieces
								remaining in place in the relay room, not to the stuff being disconnected when the test
								deck was removed. And the wires they added had the unintended consequence of causing C
								end of 1524 points to give detection when they were only swung halfway across. &#160;At
								that point the motors would stop, leaving the points &#8220;split&#8221; on the ground
								but showing as set correctly in Wimbledon signal box.<br />
								<br />
								The tester should not have been adding wires at all. &#160;One of the conclusions of
								Clapham Junction was that all resignalling wiring work should be tested by someone other
								than the person doing it. &#160;So no tester should ever make alterations, as how can
								they then test it. Two electricians were also on duty in the relay room and the
								functional tester gave evidence that the problematic wiring was actually added by them.
								&#160;They denied it, and the sign in sheet shows they were probably both out at lunch
								when it happened. When questioned about the consequence of adding the wires in the
								locations in question the functional tester showed worrying gaps in knowledge.<br />
								<br />
								The wiring installed should have been labelled and it was not. &#160;When the track was
								handed back a wire count should have been done &#8211; this in particular was a key
								requirement from Clapham. &#160;But the entire exercise of using a test deck, which is
								accepted industry wide for large projects, makes a wire count impossible as the wiring
								to put it in and take it out has to remain in place for a long time, and is not shown on
								the diagram the count is conducted off.<br />
								<br />
								The functional tester was not a Network Rail employee. &#160;They were employed by an
								external contractor, whose competency management processes were called into question.
								&#160;Their assessment regime had not picked up the holes in the functional
								tester&#8217;s knowledge. More worryingly it had not picked up gaps in their &#8220;soft
								skills&#8221; &#8211; i.e. the ability to sit back and have a think before just going
								and doing whatever worked to solve the immediate problem. &#160;The tester had lost
								their licence to work in that role in the past for contravening signalling standards,
								and the training plan that allowed them to regain the necessary qualifications
								hadn&#8217;t properly addressed their shortcomings.<br />
								<br />
								We have hundreds of procedures, requirements, qualifications, and standards to prevent
								what happened at Clapham. &#160;It shouldn&#8217;t be possible for someone with limited
								knowledge to just walk into a relay room and create unsafe situations. &#160;But if the
								companies assessing those doing that work are deficient then we have a problem. If
								Network Rail has no oversight over those companies and their assessment processes we
								have a problem. And if large scale projects are consistently planned on the basis of
								non-compliance then we have a problem.<br />
								<br />
								In their investigation into this the RAIB has made the point that a large part of why
								the recommendations from Clapham have worked is the industry wide willingness to abide
								by them. &#160;This in turn is driven by some quite vivid memories of the consequences
								of not doing so. In 30 years that has eroded. No amount of processes are going to do the
								job without individual and organisational will behind them. &#160;It will be interesting
								to see if near misses are enough to refresh that will.<br />

								<br />
								I don't think that's fair if you're thinking of it as something specific to the railway.
								If you read those long form posts on the Egypt air or air France crashes the airline
								industry doesn't come out particularly well. A deep dive into a single incident is
								valuable for showing how everything can go wrong but also highlights just how many
								safety features there are that needed to be subverted for the incident to happen. <br />
								<br />
								Take this Waterloo incident for example. In theory the electricians, who have regular
								assesments, put in wiring from a diagram. That is tested by two different testers who
								have some pretty beefy qualifications on which they are also regularly assessed. All
								wires added are labelled and colour coded. When the work is done a wire count is
								completed so that the wiring diagram and the actual wires marry up exactly. <br />
								<br />
								Those are some quite thorough precautions. For various worrying reasons they all failed
								in this instance. But to say it's the wild west really undersells how complex this stuff
								is, and how difficult it is to ensure compliance throughout. The notable thing in this
								incident is that it is possible, not that it is common. <br />
								<br />
								You have to remember the inherent risks of the endeavour when considering whether they
								are generally well controlled or not. If you went to a risk management expert of some
								description and said "What we're going to do is fill metal crates with thousands of
								people, then run them at speeds over a hundred miles an hour at sufficient frequency
								that they are actually closer together than their individual braking curves. What do you
								recommend to control the risks involved?" Their answer would likely be "Don't do that".

								<br />
								My take on this is that the reasons it looks scary are the engineering aspects of it.
								The layout looks pretty standard. <br />
								<br />
								It's a flyover. That inherently reduces risk. The lines down the middle appear to go
								straight on, and the ones on the outside go eventually off to the left. So it's a left
								hand turn, and from the other direction a right hand merge. <br />
								<br />
								If you had to design a road layout with a left hand turn and two way traffic you could
								just slap the roads together. But that means to change direction you always have to
								cross lanes of traffic. So you've got conflict points. A manageable risk at low speed
								and with low traffic numbers. But if you had high speeds and high traffic numbers the
								risks are too great. You don't get many straight junctions on motorways here. I don't
								know how it is in the us on freeways. <br />
								<br />
								That's why the lines here cross over the top. Otherwise stuff going straight on from our
								perspective (on the left hand track) would have to cross over the lines of the stuff
								coming from the left. In the setup in this video there are fewer conflicting moves.
								<br />
								<br />
								What is interesting to me is there are no lineside signals, so it's either in cab
								signalling or automatic train operation. Judging by the speed the train is approaching
								the junction when the points aren't set I'm guessing it's ATO of some description.

								Having encouraged train chat I feel I have to comment a little bit about the thread
								title. I know it may seem like a sense of humour failure, but it's more that I want to
								crowbar in one of my pet subjects regarding train drivers, and Phiz Khalifa's toxic
								masculinity meltdown kind of allows for that. <br />
								<br />
								This industry is incredibly sexist. Like, holy shit you have no idea. It's like stepping
								into a time warp. The shitty division of labour in the home that means women often end
								up with the brunt of child caring responsibilities makes workplaces like this that rely
								on 24hr shiftwork very male dominated. Most of the employees therefore have very 1970s
								traditional homelives where the husband works and the wife stays home and looks after
								the kids. The advances that have been made elsewhere have left the railway behind.
								<br />
								<br />
								Being breeds consciousness. Because that traditional setup is so common really
								"traditional" i.e. fucking awful, attitudes are also common. And because they're so
								prevalent they're hard to challenge without isolating yourself. So people often don't.
								It all combines to create a really hostile working environment for women. <br />
								<br />
								I recently had an incredibly qualified and competent colleague who has just got a job as
								a driver. They are a young, attractive, woman. And they're incredibly outgoing and,
								basically, flirty. That's just how she is. It's how she wants to be. And she shouldn't
								have to be any other way for the sake of some old sexist arseholes. Toxic masculinity
								often means women only get accepted in these environments if they try and "out-bloke"
								the blokes. I just dread to think the kind of shit she's going to have to deal with. I
								wonder if it'll drive her out. <br />
								<br />
								I have also never talked to a frontline female colleague who hasn't been the victim of
								sexual assault by the traveling public. They may not call it that, but the experiences
								they describe fit the description. Literally every single one, if you talk about that
								subject, has had it happen to them. So the punters aren't exactly helping either. <br />
								<br />
								So yeah, it's fun to say train drivers are truck fucking badasses, but in reality one of
								the biggest battles in that workplace is against the idea that you have to be a certain
								type of person to do the job, i.e. principally a straight guy.

								<br />
								The intersection of trains and roads seems to me to be a huge blindspot in the way the
								railway evaluates risk (speaking about the UK as usual though). <br />
								<br />
								I recently had some involvement in the aftermath of a near miss at a level crossing that
								could have been absolutely catastrophic. But all the risk rankings came out low, as the
								level crossing was effectively not calculated as part of the ranking. <br />
								<br />
								The risk ranking score for this type of event , which mandates the level of response,
								takes into consideration the likelihood of the train crossing a "conflict point" and the
								severity of it doing so. Level crossings are typically not considered to be conflict
								points. Instead the position of the next train that could be struck is used for the
								calculations as a rule. <br />
								<br />
								So in the incident I was involved with the conflict point was calculated to be over a
								kilometre away, making the incident relatively low risk. On paper.

								Bored at work so have some more train shit. &#160;No particular moral to the story, but
								hopefully interesting to some.<br />
								<br />
								The Lewisham train crash of 1957. Lewisham is in the southeast of London. &#160;On the
								evening of 4th December 1957 fog descended onto London. On the busy Kent suburban routes
								out of London towards the southeast of England it was particularly bad. &#160;Visibility
								dropped to a few meters in places. Trains crawled out of London and the delays started
								piling up.<br />
								<br />
								As trains leave Cannon Street, Charing Cross, and London Bridge out towards the
								southeast they pass New Cross station, St Johns station, and then Parks Bridge junction.
								&#160;At the time all of these had their own signal box. Because everything was running
								late the St Johns signaller sent the Parks Bridge signaller a train out of its normal
								order. &#160;The Parks Bridge signaller held it to query what was going on. This took
								several minutes so the St Johns signaller had no choice but to hold the next train, the
								17:18 electric Charing Cross to Hayes service, at the signal behind.<br />
								<br />
								The next train behind that one was the 16:56 Cannon Street to Ramsgate. A &#8220;Battle
								of Britain&#8221; style steam train hauling 11 passenger coaches. &#160;In charge was 62
								year old Driver Trew, a 45 year veteran of working on the railway and an 18 year veteran
								of driving steam trains. With him in the cab was Fireman Hoare. &#160;Trew drove past
								L18 signal at the end of St Johns platform at around 30-40 mph. About 130 yards after
								passing the signal he hit the back of the Hayes train, largely demolishing the rear few
								coaches. &#160;<br />
								<br />
								Driver Skilton, driving the Hayes train felt a comparatively mild bump. &#160;This
								betrayed little of the carnage going on behind him. He was on an uphill gradient so had
								the brakes hard on. &#160;The front coaches didn&#8217;t really move a great deal and
								the impact was largely &#8220;absorbed&#8221; by the rear coaches, and the people in
								them. To make matter worse the Hayes train had been held exactly where the Nunhead lines
								cross over the top of the Kent lines. &#160;As the wreckage of the rear coaches was
								pushed forward it demolished the middle support of the overhead bridge. The lines above
								collapsed onto the wreckage of the two trains. 89 people were killed, including the
								guard of the Hayes train but miraculously not including Trew and Hoare in the front of
								the Ramsgate steam train.<br />
								<br />
								There was another driver in the front of the Hayes train, Driver Crane. &#160;They were
								supposed to be travelling as a passenger home for the day but Skilton had asked them to
								come up and help him sight signals in the fog. &#160;Crane walked back and found the
								largely uninjured Trew in the wreckage of the steam engine. He later reported he
								&#8220;could get nothing out of him&#8221;, and helped escort him down the bank into a
								nearby house. &#160;Numerous local residents had already called the emergency services.
								Trew was in shock and it was almost a month before he was able to really give any kind
								of account of what had happened.<br />
								<br />
								Meanwhile a Dartford train approached on the Nunhead lines overhead. &#160;Somehow,
								despite visibility of only a few meters, Driver Corke approaching the bridge noticed
								that a few of the upright girders appeared at an angle. He applied the brakes and
								stopped a few meters before the now demolished bridge. Given what was and wasn&#8217;t
								apparently visible to other drivers at the time this is frankly stellar work.<br />
								<br />
								Steam trains are driven from the left hand side of the cab, with the driver looking out
								of the left hand side window down the side of the boiler. &#160;The fireman stands on
								the right, stokes the fire, and can also observe out of the right hand side window. The
								problem here, which was particularly acute on approach to St Johns, is that the driver
								has very little visibility of things on their right.<br />
								<br />
								As you approach St Johns, travelling southeast, the line curves to the left. &#160;All
								signals were mounted on the right hand side of the track to assist visibility from a
								distance. &#160;That meant that when driving a Battle of Britain steam engine the
								signals were visible for quite some time in the distance, but then went out of view as
								you got closer &#8211; the boiler in the middle of the train completely blocked them
								from view from the drivers window. L18 was later recorded as being visible to the driver
								from about 500 yards, but then disappearing from view at about 238 yards. The signal
								before went out of view at about 90 yards distance. &#160;The one before that at about
								80 yards distance. Due to the fog visibility on that evening from New Cross to St Johns
								was recorded as about 20 to 30 yards at most. So drivers of steam trains would not have
								seen any of the signals after leaving New Cross.<br />
								<br />
								That is obviously not good. &#160;It wasn&#8217;t insurmountable though. &#160;The
								driver of the last steam train before Trew&#8217;s to go down that line asked the
								fireman to sight signals after leaving New Cross. &#160;Trew did not ask Hoare to do
								this for some reason. Hoare didn&#8217;t choose to do so by his own accord. He told Trew
								L18 was red about 20 yards before they passed it. &#160;This was the first signal
								they&#8217;d seen since the green at New Cross. Trew could also have simply walked
								across the cab to look out. He did not.<br />
								<br />
								In his first interview Trew said he&#8217;d seen the green at New Cross, then the double
								yellow, then the yellow, then seen the red with about 20 yards to go and applied the
								brakes. &#160;As we can see above it was simply impossible for him to have seen those
								signals without crossing the cab, which he said he hadn&#8217;t done. In a later
								interview he said he&#8217;d not seen any signals after leaving New Cross.<br />
								<br />
								When Trew was asked what he thought when he&#8217;d seen the green at New Cross he
								correctly said that it meant the earliest place he could get a red was at St Johns.
								&#160;The green meant that at minimum the next signal was double yellow, and the next
								one after would be yellow. He was asked if he had ever been held at L18 at St Johns
								before. &#160;He said he had not. Neither had Hoare. It seems clear that what went on in
								Trew&#8217;s head when he was driving was that he didn&#8217;t need to look until St
								Johns, and that when he got there and asked Hoare what the signal was he was expecting a
								green or a yellow. &#160;He simply was not driving the train in such a way that he could
								hope to stop at L18, regardless what it was displaying.<br />
								<br />
								A coroners jury decided by majority verdict this amounted to death by gross negligence.
								&#160;The coroner overturned them and returned a verdict of accidental death. Trew was
								tried for manslaughter but the jury there couldn&#8217;t agree on a verdict. &#160;He
								was later retried and acquitted.<br />
								<br />
								This accident followed a few SPAD related catastrophes. &#160;In 1952 a SPAD at Harrow
								in North West London had resulted in 112 people being killed. &#160;In that incident the
								driver had passed a double yellow, then a single yellow, then a red, without reacting.
								&#160;It was never established why as they were killed along with the fireman. The
								outcome was that Automatic Warning System was introduced. &#160;I mentioned this in the
								Southall write up from a few months ago. A magnet is positioned on approach to every
								signal. When the train passes over it a bell sounds in the cab if the signal is green.
								&#160;A horn sounds if the signal is yellow or red, and the driver has to cancel the
								horn by pressing a plunger within a few seconds or the brakes come on. There is an
								associated visual indicator in the cab as well, which turns yellow and black when the
								horn sounds. &#160;It is an audio and visual reminder to the driver that they are
								approaching a cautionary signal. At the very least this should prompt the driver to look
								out the window. That is likely all it would have taken to prevent the Lewisham accident,
								although it is of course not fool proof.<br />
								<br />
								AWS had not yet been introduced on this section of the line. &#160;The earliest trials
								of it were on the busy sections from Waterloo to the South West that still had semaphore
								signals rather than colour lights. &#160;No changes were recommended to the schedule to
								install AWS as semaphore signals were still considered to be higher risk. A
								recommendation was made that Battle of Britain engines were to be made wider where
								possible, so that the driver&#8217;s window could be made a bit bigger. &#160;All
								Pacific class steam engines, of which Battle of Britain engines were a part, were
								withdrawn by 1967.<br />
								<br />
								The bridge was replaced by a temporary military structure which, of course, is still
								there today.<br />

								Yeah, always thought that was a bit dubious. I've been involved in incidents where
								people have tested positive for substances in a big way and even then it was not
								possible to say for sure what impact that might have had. It isn't treated as a cut and
								dried thing in the way that old classic implies. <br />
								<br />
								The stuff about the physics is great though. I have no idea if it's true but it sounds
								all too plausible and terrifying.<br />
								<br />
								When I trained I was only taught if you're going to have a collision:<br />
								<br />
								1. Emergency brake<br />
								2. Repeatedly sound the horn<br />
								3. Emergency call to the signaller<br />
								<br />
								That last one will automatically send a stop message to all trains in the area, so the
								other line is protected. I was never taught to get out of the cab but you can damn well
								be sure I'd try if I thought it would help.<br />
								<br />
								Modern signalling still has to be compliant for steam trains. Charter trains and tourist
								stuff like the Harry Potter express are still out there on the mainline. So even now
								that small window is a huge headache for signal scheme designers.

								A while ago we were talking about a runaway freight train near Sydney. &#160;It went
								down a 30kph limit mountain out of control and reached a top speed of 107kph. &#160;The
								runaway movement went on for 13 minutes and covered a total of 14km. Just read the
								report from that one. &#160;I don&#8217;t really understand a lot of the technical stuff
								but it seems like driver error (with the suspicion of a poor culture of minimal
								competency assessments).<br />
								<br />
								It was a heavily loaded freight train coming down an apparently notoriously steep
								incline. &#160;The driver stopped at the top and tested the brakes, then went down the
								mountain. They made ten brake applications to control the speed, but because of the type
								of brakes this basically ran out the air reserve so the brakes would no longer work.
								&#160;The technical shit is completely beyond me but apparently the driver did not wait
								for the brakes to recharge after each application. I don&#8217;t know if that means you
								are supposed to make fewer but longer applications, with more space between, or just to
								make fewer in general.<br />
								<br />
								That sounds similar to how people describe vacuum brakes working on old British Rail
								slam door stock. &#160;You had 3 brake applications for each stop, and then that was it
								&#8211; the brake handle just wouldn&#8217;t do anything until it was recharged. &#160;I
								find that absolutely terrifying. Imagine coming towards a buffer stop and knowing if you
								didn&#8217;t get it right in the first three go&#8217;s you wouldn&#8217;t get a fourth.
								&#160;<br />
								<br />
								That has actually also led to a bit of a culture among older drivers where the mark of
								good driving is using the fewest brake applications possible. &#160;I spent some time
								with an Instructor who had been driving for about 35 years who was obsessed with the
								&#8220;coconut&#8221; &#8211; one brake application stops that come in perfectly in the
								right place. &#160;He could reliably approach a station, put the brake handle to step 2,
								and then pretty much sit on his hands until the train stopped exactly on the end of the
								platform. I was hopeless at it, but fortunately the trains I was driving have brakes
								that you can take on and off as much as you like so it didn&#8217;t really matter (bit
								bumpy though - sorry). <br />
								<br />
								Aside from the fact that this seems like a massive safety flaw in the design of the most
								basic safety feature of the train &#8211; the bit that stops it when you want it to stop
								&#8211; I am not at all clear on why the driver did this. &#160;They were experienced
								and did the run down the mountain regularly. I have no idea why they would brake in this
								way when they knew as an experienced driver of this type of train that the brakes would
								stop responding over time.<br />
								<br />
								It is noticeable that one of the recommendations from this is that Qube, the freight
								operator, are going to assess drivers over this route more frequently. &#160;I am
								utterly clueless as to why this is as there is zero mention in the report of this being
								an issue of competency fade that assessments could have identified. &#160;Clearly
								someone has come to that conclusion but not actually bothered to do the legwork of
								writing that up. The recommendation just seems to hang in the air, supported by nothing
								and related to nothing. &#160;It&#8217;s a real &#8220;draw your own conclusions&#8221;
								situation.<br />
								<br />
								The train was overweight as well. &#160;Each trip the people loading it write up what
								the carriage weight for each wagon. &#160;The driver and guard then sign to confirm. The
								weight was found to be incorrect by about 10%. &#160;The driver and the guard knew this
								but the write up had not been changed. The driver needs to know the weight as it affects
								braking. &#160;He said he drove it with the higher weight in mind. Why not change the
								paperwork then? Seems to indicate a rather casual attitude to the effect the weight
								might have. &#160;Or maybe they were in a hurry. It might be the kind of thing that only
								looks significant in hindsight.<br />
								<br />
								And finally the train was moved after the event, before being examined properly by any
								technicians or investigators. &#160;It was moved by the original driver, on instructions
								of the controller. The controller wanted it out of the way so as not to affect the
								service, but it meant evidence was lost. &#160;Also the driver should never have been
								put in that position. He had just been in the front of a train going over 100kph with
								absolutely no brake control for over 10 minutes. Poor guy must have been in pieces.
								&#160;Out of simple compassion he should not have been asked to take the train forward.
								I am looking at this from a former driver&#8217;s perspective though, so it might be our
								former controller poster has a different angle on that. &#160;I&#8217;m sure that job
								comes with its own intense pressures, to put it mildly.<br />
								<br />
								The driver was in communication with the controller for most of this &#8211; as soon as
								he was aware the train was out of control he called it in. &#160;The controller cleared
								all routes and set all points ahead so there would be no collision. I can only assume it
								was due to their actions that this was not a massive accident.<br />

								The other report I&#8217;ve seen recently that&#8217;s interesting is the report into
								the head on collision in Germany back in 2016. &#160;The circumstances are that there
								was a single line section with a series of passing loops &#8211; like the Uckfield line
								I wrote about in the past. &#160;Obviously that in itself is a risk. If there are two
								lines and trains are restricted to one direction moves on each head on collisions are
								basically impossible. &#160;A single bidirectional line opens up the possibility of
								trains being run towards each other, so you have to have some pretty substantial risk
								mitigation in place to stop that.<br />
								<br />
								The full report is in german, which I don&#8217;t speak. &#160;I&#8217;ve got a summary
								and I&#8217;ve put bits and pieces of it into google translate. &#160;I&#8217;m fucked
								if I&#8217;m going to do the whole thing bit by bit as it&#8217;s 103 pages long and too
								big to do in one go.<br />
								<br />
								A train was already running one way on the single line when the signaller used a type of
								back up signal (amusingly called an &#8220;ersatzsignal&#8221; in German, for fans of
								non-English words in common English language usage) to allow a train going the other way
								into the already occupied section. That train, in accordance with the rules proceeded at
								caution for a little while, then got up to 100kph line speed. &#160;The two trains
								collided at high speed head on and 12 people were killed, 11 at the time and one died a
								few months later from injuries. I can&#8217;t find anywhere that says if that includes
								the drivers. I would have assumed so, but the report talks about them in the present
								tense. That may be a translation thing.<br />
								<br />
								The two trains were scheduled to cross over at Kolbermoor, however one of them was
								running 4 minutes late. As departure time came for the train at Kolbermoor the signaller
								gave it the route out onto the single line section, despite the fact that the one it was
								supposed to pass was still in the section and hadn&#8217;t made the passing point
								yet.<br />
								<br />
								Interlocking means that shouldn&#8217;t be possible. &#160;The signalling system
								won&#8217;t let the signaller set a route onto an already occupied section of line.
								&#160;And in this case it didn&#8217;t. But the signaller didn&#8217;t realise why not.
								He assumed it was a technical fault of some description and overrode it using the backup
								&#8220;ersatzsignal&#8221; system.<br />
								<br />
								The ersatzsignals seem to be similar to PoSA signals here &#8211; &#8220;Proceed on
								Sight Authority&#8221;. &#160;Those are two lights mounted underneath the main signal
								aspect that, when flashing, give the driver authority to pass the signal at danger.
								&#160;They are generally fitted to high traffic areas to allow flexibility for
								signallers when something goes wrong. <br />
								<br />
								Under normal circumstances if a technical fault means the signaller loses proper
								indications for a section they will be unable to clear the route into it. &#160;That
								means that each train will have to be talked past the signal. Each driver stops at the
								red aspect as normal. Then either the signaller calls them, or after a few minutes the
								driver calls the signaller. &#160;The signaller has the power to authorise the driver to
								pass the signal at danger when they&#8217;ve confirmed the route ahead is set and they
								have ascertained there are no trains in the section ahead, i.e. everything is accounted
								for elsewhere and the last train through has been detected further down the line.
								&#160;The driver still has to proceed at caution as the reasons for the technical fault
								might be something affecting the track, like floods or obstructions.<br />
								<br />
								PoSA is just an automated method of doing the same. &#160;The driver and the signaller
								don&#8217;t have to speak. Instead the signaller does what they would do normally to
								allow the driver to pass; they confirm no trains ahead, etc, and they operate the PoSA.
								The driver does what they would normally on seeing the PoSA &#8211; they proceed at
								caution. &#160;There is no difference from the former procedure except the absence of a
								conversation between the two.<br />
								<br />
								The German version is similar but crucially is not interlocked. &#160;PoSAs can&#8217;t
								be set if the route ahead can&#8217;t be confirmed by points detection. &#160;It appears
								ersatzsignals can be used even where points detection isn&#8217;t given. In this case
								the fact that there was already a train in the section means the points to exit at the
								other end wouldn&#8217;t have been set correctly and a PoSA would not have been able to
								be turned on. &#160;All that was required for the signaller to use the ersatzsignal was
								their own decision to do so.<br />
								<br />
								They were obviously supposed to follow some pretty stringent procedures before operating
								the ersatzsignal, as those procedures are effectively the only safety systems in place.
								&#160;There is no engineered fail safe here, just a human one. And in this case the
								human one failed spectacularly as it was engaged in playing Dungeon Hunter 5 on its
								mobile.<br />
								<br />
								Analysis of this guy&#8217;s phone indicated that 72% of the shift up to that point had
								been spent on Dungeon Hunter 5. &#160;He was not using it at the moment he set the
								ersatzsignal, but was doing so only a few minutes before. He refused to answer further
								questions about his playing time in the preceding months. The investigation concluded
								this would have had a substantial negative effect on his ability to concentrate. A jury
								agreed and convicted him of 12 counts of involuntary manslaughter. He was sentenced to 5
								years in prison and was recently released after serving 2.<br />
								<br />
								I note that RAIB here in the UK have recently announced a class investigation into human
								factors, particularly looking at signalling errors. Their point is that engineered
								safeguards are most effective, then technological safeguards, and finally human ones
								rank lowest in terms of effectiveness. In Badaiblung the engineered safeguard would have
								been having two lines. The technological safeguard was the signal interlocking. The
								human safeguard was the procedure involved in overriding that and using the
								ersatzsignal. Compared to the other two our understanding of the ways human safeguards
								fail is not good. <br />
								<br />
								Oh, also the signaller realised his error and could have possibly stopped the accident
								using an emergency stop signal on the radio. <br />
								<br />
								He tried, but dialled the wrong number.

									</blockquote>
								</div>
								<br />
								This is only true up to a point. This whole discussion started because we were talking
								about an incident where a guy calculating load weight cut corners and then there was an
								incident, but it isn't at all clear the two are related.<br />
								<br />
								I'm not suggesting people in those positions are OK to cut corners, but when you're
								looking at an incident after the fact you have to consider if it actually caused what
								happened. I've lost count of the amount of investigations I've read that contained words
								to the effect of:<br />
								<br />
								"Staff member X was not carrying correct equipment for the operating instructions for
								this location. On balance of probabilities this was not considered to be a causal factor
								in this incident. Staff member X has been rebriefed on local instructions."<br />
								<br />
								It's still essential to point out the corner cutting, and look into if its a one off and
								what further impact it might have, but it's possible to use it to mask real causes and
								that could be dangerous.<br />
								<br />
								Best example I can think of relates to the Clapham Junction crash from 1988 that I wrote
								about a while ago. Because the rule book was unclear several drivers went past irregular
								signal sequences and failed to report it. If they'd reported it maybe the fault would
								have been found before the crash. So the failure to report is definitely causal.<br />
								<br />
								One of those drivers wasn't the booked driver of the train in question. They had done a
								"fiddle" with a colleague to swap work around. Happens lots. The widow of the driver who
								was killed in the crash made representations to the inquiry that the fiddle was a causal
								factor, or words to that effect. If the booked driver had been driving then the signal
								would have been reported and the crash prevented.<br />
								<br />
								The inquiry concluded that fiddles like that were bad practice and should be stopped
								(lol, they have not been). But it also concluded that the fault wouldn't have been
								reported even if everything was done above board because the rulebook was unclear. If
								the inquiry had just looked for where practice fell short of agreed procedure it might
								have missed systemic problems and ultimately not really solved anything.
