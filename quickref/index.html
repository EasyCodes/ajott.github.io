                        <p>A critical roll is considered to be an unmodified 10 on a damage roll. If the roll is 1d10, this
                            is pretty obvious. If the roll is 1d5, one must remember that a d5 in Dark Heresy is a d10, counting
                            1-2 as
                            <b>1</b>, 3-4 as
                            <b>2</b>, etc. Therefore, it is just as likely to critically roll with a d5. </p>
                        <p>Should a character make a critical roll on an attack, and if the attack inflicts damage (is not completely

                        <p>Generally, a player will make a test with the main characteristic for a skill. However, sometimes

                            - perhaps an attempt to use Deceive to craft a disguise would rely on a character's Intelligence,
                            rather than their Fellowship. Should a test need to be made with an alternate characteristic,
                            this must be determined before the roll.

                                                skill test of the individual who set the explosives. Winning the test defuses

                            <a href="#corruption">Corruption</a> is used to represent the damage to characters' very souls.
                            <br/> Insanity points start at 0, and may increase as time goes on. As characters become more Insane,
                            the effects are categorized into a variety of

                        <p>Disorders are detailed on pp. 288-289 of the core rulebook. Generally, these are left to the discretion
                            of the GM. Note that, as characters become more insane, the severity of their mental disorder
                            increases.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Minor Disorder - These are weak disorders, and any test to overcome the effects of the disorder

                        <p>Insanity points can be removed through the use of Experience. It costs 100 xp to remove a single
                            point of Insanity, and the character may never reduce their degree of madness (Stable > Unsetttled
                            > Disturbed > Unhinged > Deranged) by this method; nor may they be cured of their disorders.

                        <p>The more Insane a character is, the more jaded they are to the horrors surrounding them. Should the

                            <br/> Corruption points start at 0, and may increase as time goes on. As characters become more corrupted
                            by the forces of Chaos, their bodies may warp and twist to reflect the scarring of their befouled
                            souls. These are known as

                        <p>There are many things that may corrupt the souls of Acolytes. Generally this is left to the discretion
                            of the GM, but may include such things as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Failing a Fear test caused by a Warp entity</li>
                                <li>Exposure to the Warp without the protection of a Gellar field</li>
                                <li>The study of corrupting texts, pict-logs, or runes - even if the character does not comprehend
                                    the writings</li>

                            Each time after gaining 10 CP, a character must make a test against gaining a Malignancy. This is modified based on their
                            current degree of Corruption.
                            <b>Roll 1d100 and consult the
                                <a href="maligna">Malignancies</a> table.</b> Should the result be a Malignancy the character already posesses,
                            they must roll again.
                            <br/>
                            <br/> As characters advance in degrees of Corruption, they will be required to make a test against
                            gaining a Mutation. This test is against two Characteristics of their choosing (the same Characteristic
                            may not be used for multiple Mutation tests, so keep track). Failure on either test means they
                            gain a Mutation.
                            <b>Roll 1d100 and consult the

                        <p>Corruption is considered to be permanent. While it is possible to remove the taint of the Warp from
                            one's soul, the chances to do so are exceedingly rare. This may be done, for example, by a Living
                            Saint visiting and giving her blessing as thanks for cleansing a shrine. This would reduce a
                            character's corruption by only a small amount, usually 1-2 CP.
