                                    may be an ally or enemy. Each creature retains its Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Intelligence,
                                    Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship during the swap, but all other Characteristics
                                    are of the new host body. If either body is slain, the effect ends immediately and both
                                    parties return to their original bodies. Both suffer 1d5 Intelligence damage from the
                                    experience. If there are no creatures within range, the psyker becomes catatonic for
                                    1d5 rounds while his mind wanders the Warp. This journey causes 1d10 Willpower Damage,
                                    1d10 Intelligence Damage and 1d10 Corruption Points.</td>
