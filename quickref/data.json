As part of the process, careful rituals must also be performed to inscribe runes and litanies into the armour. This requires a Hard (-20) Scholastic Lore (Occult) or Forbidden Lore (Imperial Creed) test for each location; failure means the unguents must be cleaned off that location and the ritual started again. For each hit location treated with Unguents of Warding, the armour grants its wearer a +5 bonus to tests to resist Fear caused by characters with the Daemonic trait and to resist psychic powers. The effects of the unguents last for one month"

Instead, at the beginning of each turn the psyker is sustaining the vortex, he must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower test with -5 per metre of the vortex's current radius. If passed, he may: Increase or decrease the radius by a metre or move it metres equal to psy rating. If the psyker fails the Willpower test to sustain the vortex,its radius increases by one metre and it moves a number of metres equal to the psyker's psy rating in a random direction. If the vortex ends and the vortex disappears. If the vortex larger than the psyker's psy rating, it explodes and destroys the vortex. The psyker is hit by this damage regardless of his proximity",
