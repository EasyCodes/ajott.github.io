                    <p>
                        Characters can attempt to shrug off some effects of Fear and Shock. Doing so requires a
                        Willpower test on their next turn.
                        If they are successful, they regain their senses and act normally. Should they fail, the
                        effect
                        continues and the test can be made again the next round. This test can only be made at the
                        start
                        of their turn, or immediately if the Fear effect started on their turn.

                        souls.
                        <br /> Insanity points start at 0, and may increase as time goes on. As characters become
                        more Insane,

                        of the GM. Note that, as characters become more insane, the severity of their mental
                        disorder
                        increases.

                    <p>Corruption (CP) reflects the permanent taint of Chaos on the souls of the characters.
                        <a href="insanity">Insanity</a> governs the toll the horrors of the 41st Millennium take on
                        the mind.
                        <br /> Corruption points start at 0, and may increase as time goes on. As characters become
                        more corrupted
                        by the forces of Chaos, their bodies may warp and twist to reflect the scarring of their
                        befouled
                        souls. These are known as
                        <a href="maligna">Malignancies</a>
                        and
                        <a href="mutations">Mutations</a>, and are detailed below.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are many things that may corrupt the souls of Acolytes. Generally this is left to the
                        discretion
                        of the GM, but may include such things as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Failing a Fear test caused by a Warp entity</li>
                            <li>Exposure to the Warp without the protection of a Gellar field</li>
                            <li>The study of corrupting texts, pict-logs, or runes - even if the character does not
                                comprehend
                                the writings</li>
                            <li>Handling an artefact of the Ruinious Powers</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each time after gaining 10 CP, a character must make a test against gaining a Malignancy.
                        This is modified based on their
                        current degree of Corruption.
                        <b>Roll 1d100 and consult the
                            <a href="maligna">Malignancies</a> table.</b> Should the result be a Malignancy the
                        character already posesses,
                        they must roll again.
                        <br />
                        <br /> As characters advance in degrees of Corruption, they will be required to make a test
                        against
                        gaining a Mutation. This test is against two Characteristics of their choosing (the same
                        Characteristic
                        may not be used for multiple Mutation tests, so keep track). Failure on either test means
                        they
                        gain a Mutation.
                        <b>Roll 1d100 and consult the
                            <a href="mutations">Mutations</a> table.</b> Should the result be a Mutation the
                        character already posesses,
                        they must roll again.
                    </p>
                    <p>Corruption is considered to be permanent. While it is possible to remove the taint of the
                        Warp from
                        one's soul, the chances to do so are exceedingly rare. This may be done, for example, by a
                        Living
                        Saint visiting and giving her blessing as thanks for cleansing a shrine. This would reduce a
                        character's corruption by only a small amount, usually 1-2 CP.
